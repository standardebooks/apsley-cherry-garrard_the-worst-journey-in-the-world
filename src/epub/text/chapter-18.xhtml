			<h3><span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span>. Farthest South</h3>
			<p>Stevenson has written of a traveller whose wife slumbered by his side what time his spirit re-adventured forth in memory of days gone by. He was quite happy about it, and I suppose his travels had been peaceful, for days and nights such as these men spent coming down the Beardmore will give you nightmare after nightmare, and wake you shrieking⁠—years after.</p>
			<p>Of course they were shaken and weakened. But the conditions they had faced, and the time they had been out, do not in my opinion account entirely for their weakness nor for Evans’ collapse, which may have had something to do with the fact that he was the biggest, heaviest and most muscular man in the party. I do not believe that this is a life for such men, who are expected to pull their weight and to support and drive a larger machine than their companions, and at the same time to eat no extra food. If, as seems likely, the ration these men were eating was not enough to support the work they were doing, then it is clear that the heaviest man will feel the deficiency sooner and more severely than others who are smaller than he. Evans must have had a most terrible time: I think it is clear from the diaries that he had suffered very greatly without complaint. At home he would have been nursed in bed: here he must march (he was pulling the day he died) until he was crawling on his frostbitten hands and knees in the snow⁠—horrible: most horrible perhaps for those who found him so, and sat in the tent and watched him die. I am told that simple concussion does not kill as suddenly as this: probably some clot had moved in his brain.</p>
			<p>For one reason and another they took very nearly as long to come down the glacier with a featherweight sledge as we had taken to go up it with full loads. Seven days’ food were allowed from the Upper to the Lower Glacier Depôt. Bowers told me that he thought this was running it fine. But the two supporting parties got through all right, though they both tumbled into the horrible pressure above the Cloudmaker. The Last Return Party took 7½ days: the Polar Party 10 days: the latter had been 25½ days longer on the plateau than the former. Owing to their slow progress down the glacier the Polar Party went on short rations for the first and last time until they camped on March 19: with the exception of these days they had either their full, or more than their full ration until that date.</p>
			<p>Until they reached the Barrier on their return journey the weather can be described neither as abnormal nor as unexpected. There were 300 statute miles (260 <abbr>geo.</abbr>) to be covered to One Ton Depôt, and 150 statute miles (130 <abbr>geo.</abbr>) more from One Ton to Hut Point. They had just picked up one week’s food for five men: between the Beardmore and One Ton were three more depôts each with one week’s food for five men. They were four men: their way was across the main body of the Barrier out of sight of land, and away from any immediate influence of the comparatively warm sea ahead of them. Nothing was known of the weather conditions in the middle of the Barrier at this time of year, and no one suspected that March conditions there were very cold. Shackleton turned homeward on January 10: reached his Bluff Depôt on February 23, and Hut Point on February 28.</p>
			<p>Wilson’s diary continues:</p>
			<section class="no-header" epub:type="z3998:diary">
				<article epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
					<p>“<i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">February 18.</i> We had only five hours’ sleep. We had butter and biscuit and tea when we woke at 2 <abbr class="time">p.m.</abbr>, then came over the Gap entrance to the pony-slaughter camp, visiting a rock moraine of <abbr>Mt.</abbr> Hope on the way.”</p>
				</article>
				<article epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
					<p>“<i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">February 19.</i> Late in getting away after making up new 10-foot sledge and digging out pony meat. We made 5½ m. on a very heavy surface indeed.”<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-341" id="note-341" epub:type="noteref">341</a></p>
				</article>
			</section>
			<p>This bad surface is the feature of their first homeward marches on the Barrier. From now onwards they complain always of the terrible surfaces, but a certain amount of the heavy pulling must be ascribed to their own weakness. In the low temperatures which occurred later bad surfaces were to be expected: but now the temperatures were not really low, about zero to −17°: fine clear days for the most part and, a thing to be noticed, little wind. They wanted wind, which would probably be behind them from the south. “Oh! for a little wind,” Scott writes. “E. Evans evidently had plenty.” He was already very anxious.</p>
			<blockquote data-note="breakout">
				<p>“If this goes on we shall have a bad time, but I sincerely trust it is only the result of this windless area close to the coast and that, as we are making steadily outwards, we shall shortly escape it. It is perhaps premature [Feb. 19] to be anxious about covering distance. In all other respects things are improving. We have our sleeping-bags spread on the sledge and they are drying, but, above all, we have our full measure of food again. Tonight we had a sort of stew fry of pemmican and horseflesh, and voted it the best hoosh we had ever had on a sledge journey. The absence of poor Evans is a help to the commissariat, but if he had been here in a fit state we might have got along faster. I wonder what is in store for us, with some little alarm at the lateness of the season.”</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>And on February 20, when they made 7 miles:</p>
			<blockquote data-note="breakout">
				<p>“At present our sledge and ski leave deeply ploughed tracks which can be seen winding for miles behind. It is distressing, but as usual trials are forgotten when we camp, and good food is our lot. Pray God we get better travelling as we are not so fit as we were, and the season is advancing apace.”</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>And on February 21:</p>
			<blockquote data-note="breakout">
				<p>“We never won a march of 8½ miles with greater difficulty, but we can’t go on like this.”<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-342" id="note-342" epub:type="noteref">342</a></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>A breeze suddenly came away from <abbr class="compass">S. S. E.</abbr>, force 4 to 6 at 11 <abbr class="time">a.m.</abbr> on February 22, and they hoisted the sail on the sledge they had just picked up. They immediately lost the tracks they were following, and failed to find the cairns and camp remains which they should have picked up if they had been on the right course, which was difficult here owing to the thick weather we had on the outward march. Bowers was sure they were too near the land and they steered out, but still failed to pick up the line on which their depôts and their lives depended. Scott was convinced they were outside, not inside the line. The next morning Bowers took a round of angles, and they came to the conclusion, on slender evidence, that they were still too near the land. They had an unhappy march still off the tracks, “but just as we decided to lunch, Bowers’ wonderful sharp eyes detected an old double lunch cairn, the theodolite telescope confirmed it, and our spirits rose accordingly.”<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-343" id="note-343" epub:type="noteref">343</a> Then Wilson had another “bad attack of snow-glare: could hardly keep a chink of eye open in goggles to see the course. Fat pony hoosh.”<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-344" id="note-344" epub:type="noteref">344</a> This day they reached the Lower Barrier Depôt.</p>

			<p>They were in evil case, but they would have been all right, these men, if the cold had not come down upon them, a bolt quite literally from the blue of a clear sky: unexpected, unforetold and fatal. The cold itself was not so tremendous until you realize that they had been out four months, that they had fought their way up the biggest glacier in the world in feet of soft snow, that they had spent seven weeks under plateau conditions of rarefied air, big winds and low temperatures, and they had watched one of their companions die⁠—not in a bed, in a hospital or ambulance, nor suddenly, but slowly, night by night and day by day, with his hands frostbitten and his brain going, until they must have wondered, each man in his heart, whether in such case a human being could be left to die, that four men might live. He died a natural death and they went out on to the Barrier.</p>
			<p>Given such conditions as were expected, and the conditions for which preparation had been made, they would have come home alive and well. Some men say the weather was abnormal: there is some evidence that it was. The fact remains that the temperature dropped into the minus thirties by day and the minus forties by night. The fact also remains that there was a great lack of southerly winds, and in consequence the air near the surface was not being mixed: excessive radiation took place, and a layer of cold air formed near the ground. Crystals also formed on the surface of the snow and the wind was not enough to sweep them away. As the temperature dropped so the surface for the runners of the sledges became worse, as I explained elsewhere.<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-345" id="note-345" epub:type="noteref">345</a> They were pulling as it were through sand.</p>
			<p>In the face of the difficulties which beset them their marches were magnificent: 11½ miles on February 25 and again on the following day: 12.2 miles on February 27, and 11½ miles again on February 28 and 29. If they could have kept this up they would have come through without a doubt. But I think it was about now that they suspected, and then were sure, that they could not pull through. Scott’s diary, written at lunch, March 2, is as follows:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>“Misfortunes rarely come singly. We marched to the [Middle Barrier] depôt fairly easily yesterday afternoon, and since that have suffered three distinct blows which have placed us in a bad position. First, we found a shortage of oil; with most rigid economy it can scarce carry us to the next depôt on this surface [71 miles away]. Second, Titus Oates disclosed his feet, the toes showing very bad indeed, evidently bitten by the late temperatures. The third blow came in the night, when the wind, which we had hailed with some joy, brought dark overcast weather. It fell below −40° in the night, and this morning it took 1½ hours to get our footgear on, but we got away before eight. We lost cairn and tracks together and made as steady as we could <abbr class="compass">N.</abbr> by <abbr class="compass">W.</abbr>, but have seen nothing. Worse was to come⁠—the surface is simply awful. In spite of strong wind and full sail we have only done 5½ miles. We are in a <em>very</em> queer street, since there is no doubt we cannot do the extra marches and feel the cold horribly.”<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-346" id="note-346" epub:type="noteref">346</a></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>They did nearly ten miles that day, but on March 3 they had a terrible time. “God help us,” wrote Scott, “we can’t keep up this pulling, that is certain. Amongst ourselves we are unendingly cheerful, but what each man feels in his heart I can only guess. Putting on footgear in the morning is getting slower and slower, therefore every day more dangerous.”</p>
			<p>The following extracts are taken from Scott’s diary.</p>
			<section class="no-header" epub:type="z3998:diary">
				<article epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
					<p>“<i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">March 4. Lunch.</i> We are in a very tight place indeed, but none of us despondent <em>yet</em>, or at least we preserve every semblance of good cheer, but one’s heart sinks as the sledge stops dead at some sastrugi behind which the surface sand lies thickly heaped. For the moment the temperature is in the −20°⁠—an improvement which makes us much more comfortable, but a colder snap is bound to come again soon. I fear that Oates at least will weather such an event very poorly. Providence to our aid! We can expect little from man now except the possibility of extra food at the next depôt. It will be real bad if we get there and find the same shortage of oil. Shall we get there? Such a short distance it would have appeared to us on the summit! I don’t know what I should do if Wilson and Bowers weren’t so determinedly cheerful over things.”</p>

					<p>“<i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">Monday, March 5. Lunch.</i> Regret to say going from bad to worse. We got a slant of wind yesterday afternoon, and going on 5 hours we converted our wretched morning run of 3½ miles into something over 9. We went to bed on a cup of cocoa and pemmican solid with the chill off. … The result is telling on all, but mainly on Oates, whose feet are in a wretched condition. One swelled up tremendously last night and he is very lame this morning. We started march on tea and pemmican as last night⁠—we pretend to prefer the pemmican this way. Marched for 5 hours this morning over a slightly better surface covered with high moundy sastrugi. Sledge capsized twice; we pulled on foot, covering about 5½ miles. We are two pony marches and 4 miles about from our depôt. Our fuel dreadfully low and the poor Soldier nearly done. It is pathetic enough because we can do nothing for him; more hot food might do a little, but only a little, I fear. We none of us expected these terribly low temperatures, and of the rest of us, Wilson is feeling them most; mainly, I fear, from his self-sacrificing devotion in doctoring Oates’ feet. We cannot help each other, each has enough to do to take care of himself. We get cold on the march when the trudging is heavy, and the wind pierces our worn garments. The others, all of them, are unendingly cheerful when in the tent. We mean to see the game through with a proper spirit, but it’s tough work to be pulling harder than we ever pulled in our lives for long hours, and to feel that the progress is so slow. One can only say ‘God help us!’ and plod on our weary way, cold and very miserable, though outwardly cheerful. We talk of all sorts of subjects in the tent, not much of food now, since we decided to take the risk of running a full ration. We simply couldn’t go hungry at this time.”</p>

				<article epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
					<p>“<i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">Tuesday, March 6. Lunch.</i> We did a little better with help of wind yesterday afternoon, finishing 9½ miles for the day, and 27 miles from depôt. But this morning things have been awful. It was warm in the night and for the first time during the journey I overslept myself by more than an hour; then we were slow with footgear; then, pulling with all our might (for our lives) we could scarcely advance at rate of a mile an hour; then it grew thick and three times we had to get out of harness to search for tracks. The result is something less than 3½ miles for the forenoon. The sun is shining now and the wind gone. Poor Oates is unable to pull, sits on the sledge when we are track-searching⁠—he is wonderfully plucky, as his feet must be giving him great pain. He makes no complaint, but his spirits only come up in spurts now, and he grows more silent in the tent. We are making a spirit lamp to try and replace the primus when our oil is exhausted …”</p>
				</article>
				<article epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
					<p>“<i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">Wednesday, March 7.</i> A little worse, I fear. One of Oates’ feet <em>very</em> bad this morning; he is wonderfully brave. We still talk of what we will do together at home.</p>
					<p>“We only made 6½ miles yesterday. This morning in 4½ hours we did just over 4 miles. We are 16 from our depôt. If we only find the correct proportion of food there and this surface continues, we may get to the next depôt [<abbr>Mt.</abbr> Hooper, 72 miles farther] but not to One Ton Camp. We hope against hope that the dogs have been to <abbr>Mt.</abbr> Hooper; then we might pull through. If there is a shortage of oil again we can have little hope. One feels that for poor Oates the crisis is near, but none of us are improving, though we are wonderfully fit considering the really excessive work we are doing. We are only kept going by good food. No wind this morning till a chill northerly air came ahead. Sun bright and cairns showing up well. I should like to keep the track to the end.”</p>
				</article>
				<article epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
					<p>“<i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">Thursday, March 8. Lunch.</i> Worse and worse in morning; poor Oates’ left foot can never last out, and time over footgear something awful. Have to wait in night footgear for nearly an hour before I start changing, and then am generally first to be ready. Wilson’s feet giving trouble now, but this mainly because he gives so much help to others. We did 4½ miles this morning and are now 8½ miles from the depôt⁠—a ridiculously small distance to feel in difficulties, yet on this surface we know we cannot equal half our old marches, and that for that effort we expend nearly double the energy. The great question is: What shall we find at the depôt? If the dogs have visited it we may get along a good distance, but if there is another short allowance of fuel, God help us indeed. We are in a very bad way, I fear, in any case.”</p>
				</article>
				<article epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
					<p>“<i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">Saturday, March 10.</i> Things steadily downhill. Oates’ foot worse. He has rare pluck and must know that he can never get through. He asked Wilson if he had a chance this morning, and of course Bill had to say he didn’t know. In point of fact he has none. Apart from him, if he went under now, I doubt whether we could get through. With great care we might have a dog’s chance, but no more. The weather conditions are awful, and our gear gets steadily more icy and difficult to manage. …</p>
					<p>“Yesterday we marched up the depôt, <abbr>Mt.</abbr> Hooper. Cold comfort. Shortage on our allowance all round. I don’t know that any one is to blame. The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares had a bad trip home I suppose.</p>
					<p>“This morning it was calm when we breakfasted, but the wind came from the <abbr class="compass">W. N. W.</abbr> as we broke camp. It rapidly grew in strength. After travelling for half an hour I saw that none of us could go on facing such conditions. We were forced to camp and are spending the rest of the day in a comfortless blizzard camp, wind quite foul.”</p>
				</article>
				<article epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
					<p>“<i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">Sunday, March 11.</i> Titus Oates is very near the end, one feels. What we or he will do, God only knows. We discussed the matter after breakfast; he is a brave fine fellow and understands the situation, but he practically asked for advice. Nothing could be said but to urge him to march as long as he could. One satisfactory result to the discussion: I practically ordered Wilson to hand over the means of ending our troubles to us, so that any one of us may know how to do so. Wilson had no choice between doing so and our ransacking the medicine case. We have 30 opium tabloids apiece and he is left with a tube of morphine. So far the tragical side of our story.</p>
					<p>“The sky completely overcast when we started this morning. We could see nothing, lost the tracks, and doubtless have been swaying a good deal since⁠—3.1 miles for the forenoon⁠—terribly heavy dragging⁠—expected it. Know that 6 miles is about the limit of our endurance now, if we get no help from wind or surfaces. We have 7 days’ food and should be about 55 miles from One Ton Camp tonight, 6 × 7 = 42, leaving us 13 miles short of our distance, even if things get no worse. Meanwhile the season rapidly advances.”</p>
				</article>
				<article epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
					<p>“<i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">Monday, March 12.</i> We did 6.9 miles yesterday, under our necessary average. Things are left much the same, Oates not pulling much, and now with hands as well as feet pretty well useless. We did 4 miles this morning in 4 hours 20 <abbr>min.</abbr>⁠—we may hope for 3 this afternoon 7 × 6 = 42. We shall be 47 miles from the depôt. I doubt if we can possibly do it. The surface remains awful, the cold intense, and our physical condition running down. God help us! Not a breath of favourable wind for more than a week, and apparently liable to head winds at any moment.”</p>

				<article epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
					<p>“<i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">Wednesday, March 14.</i> No doubt about the going downhill, but everything going wrong for us. Yesterday we woke to a strong northerly wind with <abbr>temp.</abbr> −37°. Couldn’t face it, so remained in camp till 2, then did 5¼ miles. Wanted to march later, but party feeling the cold badly as the breeze (N.) never took off entirely, and as the sun sank the <abbr>temp.</abbr> fell. Long time getting supper in dark.</p>
					<p>“This morning started with southerly breeze, set sail and passed another cairn at good speed; halfway, however, the wind shifted to <abbr class="compass">W.</abbr> by <abbr class="compass">S.</abbr> or <abbr class="compass">W. S. W.</abbr>, blew through our wind-clothes and into our mitts. Poor Wilson horribly cold, could [not] get off ski for some time. Bowers and I practically made camp, and when we got into the tent at last we were all deadly cold. Then <abbr>temp.</abbr> now midday down −43° and the wind strong. We <em>must</em> go on, but now the making of every camp must be more difficult and dangerous. It must be near the end, but a pretty merciful end. Poor Oates got it again in the foot. I shudder to think what it will be like tomorrow. It is only with greatest pains rest of us keep off frostbites. No idea there could be temperatures like this at this time of year with such winds. Truly awful outside the tent. Must fight it out to the last biscuit, but can’t reduce rations.”</p>

					<p>“<i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">Friday, March 16, or Saturday, 17.</i> Lost track of dates, but think the last correct. Tragedy all along the line. At lunch, the day before yesterday, poor Titus Oates said he couldn’t go on; he proposed we should leave him in his sleeping-bag. That we could not do, and we induced him to come on, on the afternoon march. In spite of its awful nature for him he struggled on and we made a few miles. At night he was worse and we knew the end had come.</p>
					<p>“Should this be found I want these facts recorded. Oates’ last thoughts were of his mother, but immediately before he took pride in thinking that his regiment would be pleased with the bold way in which he met his death. We can testify to his bravery. He has borne intense suffering for weeks without complaint, and to the very last was able and willing to discuss outside subjects. He did not⁠—would not⁠—give up hope till the very end. He was a brave soul. This was the end. He slept through the night before last, hoping not to wake; but he woke in the morning⁠—yesterday. It was blowing a blizzard. He said, ‘I am just going outside and may be some time.’ He went out into the blizzard and we have not seen him since.</p>
					<p>“I take this opportunity of saying that we have stuck to our sick companions to the last. In case of Edgar Evans, when absolutely out of food and he lay insensible, the safety of the remainder seemed to demand his abandonment, but Providence mercifully removed him at this critical moment. He died a natural death, and we did not leave him till two hours after his death. We knew that poor Oates was walking to his death, but though we tried to dissuade him, we knew it was the act of a brave man and an English gentleman. We all hope to meet the end with a similar spirit, and assuredly the end is not far.</p>
					<p>“I can only write at lunch and then only occasionally. The cold is intense, −40° at midday. My companions are unendingly cheerful, but we are all on the verge of serious frostbites, and though we constantly talk of fetching through I don’t think any one of us believes it in his heart.</p>
					<p>“We are cold on the march now, and at all times except meals. Yesterday we had to lay up for a blizzard and today we move dreadfully slowly. We are at <abbr>No.</abbr> 14 Pony Camp, only two pony marches from One Ton Depôt. We leave here our theodolite, a camera, and Oates’ sleeping-bags. Diaries, etc., and geological specimens carried at Wilson’s special request, will be found with us or on our sledge.”</p>

No human being could face it, and we are worn out <em>nearly</em>.</p>
					<p>“My right foot has gone, nearly all the toes⁠—two days ago I was proud possessor of best feet. … Bowers takes first place in condition, but there is not much to choose after all. The others are still confident of getting through⁠—or pretend to be⁠—I don’t know! We have the last <em>half</em> fill of oil in our primus and a very small quantity of spirit⁠—this alone between us and thirst. The wind is fair for the moment, and that is perhaps a fact to help.

Then, contrary to expectation, we got warm and all slept well. Today we started in the usual dragging manner. Sledge dreadfully heavy. We are 15½ miles from the depôt and ought to get there in three days. What progress! We have two days’ food but barely a day’s fuel. All our feet are getting bad⁠—Wilson’s best, my right foot worse, left all right. There is no chance to nurse one’s feet till we can get hot food into us. Amputation is the least I can hope for now, but will the trouble spread? That is the serious question.

					<p>“<i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">Thursday, March 29.</i> Since the 21st we have had a continuous gale from <abbr class="compass">W. S. W.</abbr> and <abbr class="compass">S. W.</abbr> We had fuel to make two cups of tea apiece and bare food for two days on the 20th. Every day we have been ready to start for our depôt <em>11 miles</em> away, but outside the door of the tent it remains a scene of whirling drift. I do not think we can hope for any better things now. We shall stick it out to the end, but we are getting weaker, of course, and the end cannot be far.</p>

				<p epub:type="z3998:salutation">To <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <abbr class="name">E. A.</abbr> Wilson</p>
				<p>My Dear <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Wilson. If this letter reaches you, Bill and I will have gone out together. We are very near it now and I should like you to know how splendid he was at the end⁠—everlastingly cheerful and ready to sacrifice himself for others, never a word of blame to me for leading him into this mess. He is not suffering, luckily, at least only minor discomforts.</p>
				<p>His eyes have a comfortable blue look of hope and his mind is peaceful with the satisfaction of his faith in regarding himself as part of the great scheme of the Almighty. I can do no more to comfort you than to tell you that he died as he lived, a brave, true man⁠—the best of comrades and staunchest of friends.</p>
				<p>My whole heart goes out to you in pity. Yours,</p>

				<p epub:type="z3998:salutation">To <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bowers</p>
				<p>My Dear <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bowers. I am afraid this will reach you after one of the heaviest blows of your life.</p>
				<p>I write when we are very near the end of our journey, and I am finishing it in company with two gallant, noble gentlemen. One of these is your son. He had come to be one of my closest and soundest friends, and I appreciate his wonderful upright nature, his ability and energy. As the troubles have thickened his dauntless spirit ever shone brighter and he has remained cheerful, hopeful and indomitable to the end. …</p>

				<p epub:type="z3998:salutation">To Sir <abbr class="name">J. M.</abbr> Barrie</p>
				<p>My Dear Barrie. We are pegging out in a very comfortless spot. Hoping this letter may be found and sent to you, I write a word of farewell … Good-bye. I am not at all afraid of the end, but sad to miss many a humble pleasure which I had planned for the future on our long marches. I may not have proved a great explorer, but we have done the greatest march ever made and come very near to great success. Good-bye, my dear friend. Yours ever,</p>

				<p epub:type="z3998:postscript">We are in a desperate state, feet frozen, etc. No fuel and a long way from food, but it would do your heart good to be in our tent, to hear our songs and the cheery conversation as to what we will do when we get to Hut Point.</p>
				<p epub:type="z3998:postscript"><i>Later.</i> We are very near the end, but have not and will not lose our good cheer. We have four days of storm in our tent and nowhere’s food or fuel. We did intend to finish ourselves when things proved like this, but we have decided to die naturally in the track.<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-347" id="note-347" epub:type="noteref">347</a></p>

			<p>The following extracts are from letters written to other friends:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>“… I want to tell you that I was <em>not</em> too old for this job. It was the younger men that went under first. … After all we are setting a good example to our countrymen, if not by getting into a tight place, by facing it like men when we were there. We could have come through had we neglected the sick.”</p>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p>“Wilson, the best fellow that ever stepped, has sacrificed himself again and again to the sick men of the party. …”</p>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p>“… Our journey has been the biggest on record, and nothing but the most exceptional hard luck at the end would have caused us to fail to return.”</p>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p>“What lots and lots I could tell you of this journey. How much better has it been than lounging in too great comfort at home.”</p>
			</blockquote>
			<h3>Message To The Public</h3>
			<p>The causes of the disaster are not due to faulty organization, but to misfortune in all risks which had to be undertaken.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The loss of pony transport in March 1911 obliged me to start later than I had intended, and obliged the limits of stuff transported to be narrowed.</li>
				<li>The weather throughout the outward journey, and especially the long gale in 83° S., stopped us.</li>
				<li>The soft snow in lower reaches of glacier again reduced pace.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We fought these untoward events with a will and conquered, but it cut into our provision reserve.</p>
			<p>Every detail of our food supplies, clothing and depôts made on the interior ice-sheet and over that long stretch of 700 miles to the Pole and back, worked out to perfection. The advance party would have returned to the glacier in fine form and with surplus of food, but for the astonishing failure of the man whom we had least expected to fail. Edgar Evans was thought the strongest man of the party.</p>
			<p>The Beardmore Glacier is not difficult in fine weather, but on our return we did not get a single completely fine day; this with a sick companion enormously increased our anxieties.</p>
			<p>As I have said elsewhere, we got into frightfully rough ice and Edgar Evans received a concussion of the brain⁠—he died a natural death, but left us a shaken party with the season unduly advanced.</p>
			<p>But all the facts above enumerated were as nothing to the surprise which awaited us on the Barrier. I maintain that our arrangements for returning were quite adequate, and that no one in the world would have expected the temperatures and surfaces which we encountered at this time of the year. On the summit in lat. 85°⁠–⁠86° we had −20°, −30°. On the Barrier in lat. 82°, 10,000 feet lower, we had −30° in the day, −47° at night pretty regularly, with continuous headwind during our day marches. It is clear that these circumstances come on very suddenly, and our wreck is certainly due to this sudden advent of severe weather, which does not seem to have any satisfactory cause. I do not think human beings ever came through such a month as we have come through, and we should have got through in spite of the weather but for the sickening of a second companion, Captain Oates, and a shortage of fuel in our depôts for which I cannot account, and finally, but for the storm which has fallen on us within 11 miles of the depôt at which we hoped to secure our final supplies. Surely misfortune could scarcely have exceeded this last blow. We arrived within 11 miles of our old One Ton Camp with fuel for one last meal and food for two days. For four days we have been unable to leave the tent⁠—the gale howling about us. We are weak, writing is difficult, but for my own sake I do not regret this journey, which has shown that Englishmen can endure hardships, help one another, and meet death with as great a fortitude as ever in the past. We took risks, we knew we took them; things have come out against us, and therefore we have no cause for complaint, but bow to the will of Providence, determined still to do our best to the last. But if we have been willing to give our lives to this enterprise, which is for the honour of our country, I appeal to our countrymen to see that those who depend on us are properly cared for.</p>
			<p>Had we lived, I should have had a tale to tell of the hardihood, endurance, and courage of my companions which would have stirred the heart of every Englishman. These rough notes and our dead bodies must tell the tale, but surely, surely a great rich country like ours will see that those who are dependent on us are properly provided for.</p>
