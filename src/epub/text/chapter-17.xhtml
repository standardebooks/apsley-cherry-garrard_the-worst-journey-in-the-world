				<p>Scott returned from the Discovery Expedition impressed by the value of youth in polar work; but the five who went forward from 87° 2′ were all grown men, chosen from a body which was largely recruited on a basis of youth. Four of them were men who were accustomed to take responsibility and to lead others. Four of them had wide sledging experience and were accustomed to cold temperatures. They were none of them likely to get flurried in emergency, to panic under any circumstances, or to wear themselves out by loss of nervous control. Scott and Wilson were the most highly strung of the party: I believe that the anxiety which Scott suffered served as a stimulus against mental monotony rather than as a drain upon his energy. Scott was 43, Wilson 39, Evans 37, Oates 32, and Bowers 28 years old. Bowers was exceptionally old for his age.</p>
				<p>In the event of one man crocking a five-man party may be better able to cope with the situation, but with this doubtful exception Scott had nothing to gain and a good deal to lose by taking an extra man to the Pole. That he did so means, I think, that he considered his position a very good one at this time. He was anxious to take as many men with him as possible. I have an impression that he wanted the army represented as well as the navy. Be that as it may, he took five men: he decided to take the extra man at the last moment, and in doing so he added one more link to a chain. But he was content; and four days after the Last Return Party left them, as he lay out a blizzard, quite warm in his sleeping-bag though the midday temperature was −20°, he wrote a long diary praising his companions very highly indeed “so our five people are perhaps as happily selected as it is possible to imagine.”<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-294" id="note-294" epub:type="noteref">294</a> He speaks of Seaman Evans as being a giant worker with a really remarkable headpiece. There is no mention of the party feeling the cold, though they were now at the greatest height of their journey; the food satisfied them thoroughly. There is no shadow of trouble here: only Evans has got a nasty cut on his hand!</p>
				<p>There were more disadvantages in this five-man party than you might think. There was 5½ weeks’ food for four men: five men would eat this in about four weeks. In addition to the extra risk of breakdown, there was a certain amount of discomfort involved, for everything was arranged for four men as I have already explained; the tent was a four-man tent, and an inner lining had been lashed to the bamboos making it smaller still: when stretched out for the night the sleeping-bags of the two outside men must have been partly off the floor-cloth, and probably on the snow: their bags must have been touching the inner tent and collecting the rime which was formed there: cooking for five took about half an hour longer in the day than cooking for four⁠—half an hour off your sleep, or half an hour off your march? I do not believe that five men on the lid of a crevasse are as safe as four. Wilson writes that the stow of the sledge with five sleeping-bags was pretty high: this makes it top-heavy and liable to capsize in rough country.</p>
				<p>But what would have paralysed anybody except Bowers was the fact that they had only four pairs of ski between the five of them. To slog along on foot, in soft snow, in the middle of four men pulling rhythmically on ski, must have been tiring and even painful; and Birdie’s legs were very short. No steady swing for him, and little chance of getting his mind off the job in hand. Scott could never have meant to take on five men when he told his supporting team to leave their ski behind, only four days before he reorganized.</p>
				<p>“May I be there!” wrote Wilson of the men chosen to travel the icecap to the Pole. “About this time next year may I be there or thereabouts! With so many young bloods in the heyday of youth and strength beyond my own I feel there will be a most difficult task in making choice towards the end.” “I should like to have Bill to hold my hand when we get to the Pole,” said Scott.</p>
				<p>Wilson <em>was</em> there and his diary is that of an artist, watching the clouds and mountains, of a scientist observing ice and rock and snow, of a doctor, and above all of a man with good judgment. You will understand that the thing which really interested him in this journey was the acquisition of knowledge. It is a restrained, and for the most part a simple, record of facts. There is seldom any comment, and when there is you feel that, for this very reason, it carries more weight. Just about this time: “December 24. Very promising, thoroughly enjoyed the afternoon march”: “Christmas Day, and a real good and happy one with a very long march”: “January 1, 1912. We had only 6 hours’ sleep last night by a mistake, but I had mine solid in one piece, actually waking in exactly the same position as I fell asleep in 6 hours before⁠—never moved”: “January 2. We were surprised today by seeing a Skua gull flying over us⁠—evidently hungry but not weak. Its droppings, however, were clear mucus, nothing in them at all. It appeared in the afternoon and disappeared again about ½ hour after.” And then on January 3: “Last night Scott told us what the plans were for the South Pole. Scott, Oates, Bowers, Petty Officer Evans and I are to go to the Pole. Teddie Evans is to return from here tomorrow with Crean and Lashly. Scott finished his week’s cooking tonight and I begin mine tomorrow.” Just that.</p>
				<p>The next day Bowers wrote:</p>
				<blockquote data-note="breakout">
					<p>“I had my farewell breakfast in the tent with Teddy Evans, Crean and Lashly. After so little sleep the previous night I rather dreaded the march. We gave our various notes, messages and letters to the returning party and started off. They accompanied us for about a mile before returning, to see that all was going well. Our party were on ski with the exception of myself: I first made fast to the central span, but afterwards connected up to the toggle of the sledge, pulling in the centre between the inner ends of Captain Scott’s and <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Wilson’s traces. This was found to be the best place, as I had to go my own step.</p>
					<p>“Teddy and party gave us three cheers, and Crean was half in tears. They have a featherweight sledge to go back with of course, and ought to run down their distance easily.<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-295" id="note-295" epub:type="noteref">295</a> We found we could manage our load easily, and did 6.3 miles before lunch, completing 12.5 by 7:15 <abbr class="time eoc">p.m.</abbr> Our marching hours are nine per day. It is a long slog with a well-loaded sledge, and more tiring for me than the others, as I have no ski. However, as long as I can do my share all day and keep fit it does not matter much one way or the other.</p>
					<p>“We had our first northerly wind on the plateau today, and a deposit of snow crystals made the surface like sand latterly on the march. The sledge dragged like lead. In the evening it fell calm, and although the temperature was −16° it was positively pleasant to stand about outside the tent and bask in the sun’s rays. It was our first calm since we reached the summit too. Our socks and other damp articles which we hang out to dry at night become immediately covered with long feathery crystals exactly like plumes. Socks, mitts and finnesko dry splendidly up here during the night. We have little trouble with them compared with spring and winter journeys. I generally spread my bag out in the sun during the 1½ hours of lunch time, which gives the reindeer hair a chance to get rid of the damage done by the deposit of breath and any perspiration during the night.”<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-296" id="note-296" epub:type="noteref">296</a></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Plenty of sun, heavy surfaces, iridescent clouds … the worst windcut sastrugi I have seen, covered with bunches of crystals like gorse … ice blink all round … hairy faces and mouths dreadfully iced up on the march … hot and sweaty days’ work, but sometimes cold hands in the loops of the ski sticks … windy streaky cirrus in every direction, all thin and filmy and scrappy … horizon clouds all being wafted about. … These are some of the impressions here and there in Wilson’s diary during the first ten days of the party’s solitary march. On the whole he is enjoying himself, I think.</p>
				<p>You should read Scott’s diary yourself and form your own opinions, but I think that after the Last Return Party left him there is a load off his mind. The thing had worked so far, it was up to <em>them</em> now: that great mass of figures and weights and averages, those years of preparation, those months of anxiety⁠—no one of them had been in vain. They were up to date in distance, and there was a very good amount of food, probably more than was necessary to see them to the Pole and off the plateau on full rations. Best thought of all, perhaps, the motors with their uncertainties, the ponies with their suffering, the glacier with its possibilities of disaster, all were behind: and the two main supporting parties were safely on their way home. Here with him was a fine party, tested and strong, and only 148 miles from the Pole.</p>
				<p>I can see them, working with a businesslike air, with no fuss and no unnecessary talk, each man knowing his job and doing it: pitching the tent: finishing the camp work and sitting round on their sleeping-bags while their meal was cooked: warming their hands on their mugs: saving a biscuit to eat when they woke in the night: packing the sledge with a good neat stow: marching with a solid swing⁠—we have seen them do it so often, and they did it jolly well.</p>
				<p>And the conditions did not seem so bad.</p>
				<blockquote data-note="breakout">
					<p>“Tonight it is flat calm; the sun so warm that in spite of the temperature we can stand about outside in the greatest comfort. It is amusing to stand thus and remember the constant horrors of our situation as they were painted for us: the sun is melting the snow on the ski, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> The plateau is now very flat, but we are still ascending slowly. The sastrugi are getting more confused, predominant from the <abbr class="compass">S. E.</abbr> I wonder what is in store for us. At present everything seems to be going with extraordinary smoothness. … We feel the cold very little, the great comfort of our situation is the excellent drying effect of the sun. … Our food continues to amply satisfy. What luck to have hit on such an excellent ration. We really are an excellently found party … we lie so very comfortably, warmly clothed in our comfortable bags, within our double-walled tent.”<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-297" id="note-297" epub:type="noteref">297</a></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Then something happened.</p>
				<p>While Scott was writing the sentences you have just read, he reached the summit of the plateau and started, ever so slightly, to go downhill. The list of corrected altitudes given by Simpson in his meteorological report are of great interest: Cape Evans 0, Shambles Camp 170, Upper Glacier Depôt 7,151, Three Degree Depôt 9,392, One and a Half Degree Depôt 9,862, South Pole 9,072 feet above sea-level.<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-298" id="note-298" epub:type="noteref">298</a></p>
				<p>What happened is not quite clear, but there is no doubt that the surface became very bad, that the party began to feel the cold, and that before long Evans especially began to crock. The immediate trouble was bad surfaces. I will try and show why these surfaces should have been met in what was, you must remember, now a land which no man had travelled before.</p>
				<p>Scott laid his One and a Half Degree Depôt (<abbr>i.e.</abbr> 1½° or 90 miles from the Pole) on January 10. That day they started to go down, but for several days before that the plateau had been pretty flat. Time after time in the diaries you find crystals⁠—crystals⁠—crystals: crystals falling through the air, crystals bearding the sastrugi, crystals lying loose upon the snow. Sandy crystals, upon which the sun shines and which made pulling a terrible effort: when the sky clouds over they get along much better. The clouds form and disperse without visible reason. And generally the wind is in their faces.</p>
				<p>Wright tells me that there is certain evidence in the records which may explain these crystals. Halos are caused by crystals and nearly all those logged from the bottom of the Beardmore to the Pole and back were on this stretch of country, where the land was falling. Bowers mentions that the crystals did not appear in all directions, which goes to show that the air was not always rising, but sometimes was falling and therefore not depositing its moisture. There is no doubt that the surfaces met were very variable, and it may be that the snow lay in waves. Bowers mentions big undulations for thirty miles before the Pole, and other inequalities may have been there which were not visible. There is sometimes evidence that these crystals were formed on the windward side of these waves, and carried over by a strong wind and deposited on the lee side.</p>
				<p>It is common knowledge that as you rise in the atmosphere so the pressure decreases: in fact, it is usual to measure your height by reading the barometer. Now the air on this last stretch to the Pole was rising, for the wind was from the south, and, as we have seen, the plateau here was sloping down towards the Pole. The air, driven uphill by this southerly wind, was forced to rise. As it rose it expanded, because the pressure was less. Air which has expanded without any heat being given to it from outside, that is in a heatproof vessel, is said to expand by adiabatic expansion. Such air tends first to become saturated, and then to precipitate its moisture. These conditions were approximately fulfilled on the plateau, where the air expanded as it rose, but could get little or no heat from outside. The air therefore precipitated its moisture in the form of crystals.</p>
				<p>Owing to the rapid changes in surfaces (on one occasion they depôted their ski because they were in a sea of sastrugi, and had to walk back for them because the snow became level and soft again) Scott guessed that the coastal mountains could not be far away, and we now know that the actual distance was only 130 miles. About the same time Scott mentions that he had been afraid that they were weakening in their pulling, but he was reassured by getting a patch of good surface and finding the sledge coming as easily as of old. On the night of January 12, eight days after leaving the Last Return Party, he writes: “At camping tonight every one was chilled and we guessed a cold snap, but to our surprise the actual temperature was higher than last night, when we could dawdle in the sun. It is most unaccountable why we should suddenly feel the cold in this manner: partly the exhaustion of the march, but partly some damp quality in the air, I think. Little Bowers is wonderful; in spite of my protest he <em>would</em> take sights after we had camped tonight, after marching in the soft snow all day when we have been comparatively restful on ski.”<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-299" id="note-299" epub:type="noteref">299</a> On January 14, Wilson wrote: “A very cold grey thick day with a persistent breeze from the <abbr class="compass">S. S. E.</abbr> which we all felt considerably, but temperature was only −18° at lunch and −15° in the evening. Now just over 40 miles from the Pole.” Scott wrote the same day: “Again we noticed the cold; at lunch today all our feet were cold but this was mainly due to the bald state of our finnesko. I put some grease under the bare skin and found it make all the difference. Oates seems to be feeling the cold and fatigue more than the rest of us, but we are all very fit.” And on January 15, lunch: “We were all pretty done at camping.”<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-300" id="note-300" epub:type="noteref">300</a> And Wilson: “We made a depôt [The Last Depôt] of provisions at lunch time and went on for our last lap with nine days’ provision. We went much more easily in the afternoon, and on till 7:30 <abbr class="time eoc">p.m.</abbr> The surface was a funny mixture of smooth snow and sudden patches of sastrugi, and we occasionally appear to be on a very gradual down gradient and on a slope down from the west to east.” In the light of what happened afterwards I believe that the party was not as fit at this time as might have been expected ten days before, and that this was partly the reason why they felt the cold and found the pulling so hard. The immediate test was the bad surface, and this was the result of the crystals which covered the ground.</p>
				<p>Simpson has worked out<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-301" id="note-301" epub:type="noteref">301</a> that there is an almost constant pressure gradient driving the air on the plateau northwards parallel to the 146° <abbr class="compass">E.</abbr> meridian, and parallel also to the probable edge of the plateau. The mean velocity for the months of this December and January was about 11 miles an hour. During this plateau journey Scott logged wind force 5 and over on 23 occasions, and this wind was in their faces from the Beardmore to the Pole, and at their backs as they returned. A low temperature when it is calm is paradise compared to a higher temperature with a wind, and it is this constant pitiless wind, combined with the altitude and low temperatures, which has made travelling on the Antarctic plateau so difficult.</p>
				<p>While the mean velocity of wind during the two midsummer months seems to be fairly constant, there is a very rapid fall of temperature in January. The mean actual temperature found on the plateau this year in December was −8.6°, the minimum observed being −19.3°. Simpson remarks that “it must be accounted as one of the wonders of the Antarctic that it contains a vast area of the earth’s surface where the mean temperature during the warmest month is more than 8° below the Fahrenheit zero, and when throughout the month the highest temperature was only +5.5° <abbr class="temperature">F</abbr>.”<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-302" id="note-302" epub:type="noteref">302</a> But the mean temperature on the plateau dropped 10° in January to −18.7°, the minimum observed being −29.7°. These temperatures have to be combined with the wind force described above to imagine the conditions of the march. In the light of Scott’s previous plateau journey<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-303" id="note-303" epub:type="noteref">303</a> and Shackleton’s Polar Journey<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-304" id="note-304" epub:type="noteref">304</a> this wind was always expected by our advance parties. But there can be no doubt that the temperature falls as solar radiation decreases more rapidly than was generally supposed. Scott probably expected neither such a rapid fall of temperature, nor the very bad surfaces, though he knew that the plateau would mean a trying time, and indeed it was supposed that it would be much the hardest part of the journey.</p>
				<p>On the night of January 15, Scott wrote “it ought to be a certain thing now, and the only appalling possibility the sight of the Norwegian flag forestalling ours.”<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-305" id="note-305" epub:type="noteref">305</a> They were 27 miles from the Pole.</p>
				<p>The story of the next three days is taken from Wilson’s diary:</p>
				<section class="no-header" epub:type="z3998:diary">
					<article epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
						<p>“<i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">January 16.</i> We got away at 8 <abbr class="time">a.m.</abbr> and made 7.5 miles by 1:15, lunched, and then in 5.3 miles came on a black flag and the Norwegians’ sledge, ski, and dog tracks running about <abbr class="compass">N. E.</abbr> and <abbr class="compass">S. W.</abbr> both ways. The flag was of black bunting tied with string to a fore-and-after which had evidently been taken off a finished-up sledge. The age of the tracks was hard to guess but probably a couple of weeks⁠—or three or more. The flag was fairly well frayed at the edges. We camped here and examined the tracks and discussed things. The surface was fairly good in the forenoon −23° temperature, and all the afternoon we were coming downhill with again a rise to the W., and a fall and a scoop to the east where the Norwegians came up, evidently by another glacier.”</p>

						<p>“<i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">January 17.</i> We camped on the Pole itself at 6:30 <abbr class="time">p.m.</abbr> this evening. In the morning we were up at 5 <abbr class="time">a.m.</abbr> and got away on Amundsen’s tracks going <abbr class="compass">S. S. W.</abbr> for three hours, passing two small snow cairns, and then, finding the tracks too much snowed up to follow, we made our own beeline for the Pole: camped for lunch at 12:30 and off again from 3 to 6:30 <abbr class="time eoc">p.m.</abbr> It blew from force 4 to 6 all day in our teeth with temperature −22°, the coldest march I ever remember. It was difficult to keep one’s hands from freezing in double woollen and fur mitts. Oates, Evans, and Bowers all have pretty severe frostbitten noses and cheeks, and we had to camp early for lunch on account of Evans’ hands. It was a very bitter day. Sun was out now and again, and observations taken at lunch, and before and after supper, and at night, at 7 <abbr class="time">p.m.</abbr> and at 2 <abbr class="time">a.m.</abbr> by our time. The weather was not clear, the air was full of crystals driving towards us as we came south, and making the horizon grey and thick and hazy. We could see no sign of cairn or flag, and from Amundsen’s direction of tracks this morning he has probably hit a point about 3 miles off. We hope for clear weather tomorrow, but in any case are all agreed that he can claim prior right to the Pole itself. He has beaten us in so far as he made a race of it. We have done what we came for all the same and as our programme was made out. From his tracks we think there were only 2 men, on ski, with plenty of dogs on rather low diet. They seem to have had an oval tent. We sleep one night at the Pole and have had a double hoosh with some last bits of chocolate, and X’s cigarettes have been much appreciated by Scott and Oates and Evans. A tiring day: now turning into a somewhat starchy frozen bag. Tomorrow we start for home and shall do our utmost to get back in time to send the news to the ship.”</p>

					<article epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
						<p>“<i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">January 18.</i> Sights were taken in the night, and at about 5 <abbr class="time">a.m.</abbr> we turned out and marched from this night camp about 3¾ miles back in a <abbr class="compass">S. E.</abbr>ly direction to a spot which we judged from last night’s sights to be the Pole. Here we lunched camp: built a cairn: took photos: flew the Queen Mother’s Union Jack and all our own flags. We call this the Pole, though as a matter of fact we went ½ mile farther on in a <abbr class="compass">S.</abbr> easterly direction after taking further sights to the actual final spot, and here we left the Union Jack flying. During the forenoon we passed the Norwegians’ last southerly camp: they called it Polheim and left here a small tent with Norwegian and <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Fram</i> flags flying, and a considerable amount of gear in the tent: half reindeer sleeping-bags, sleeping-socks, reinskin trousers 2 pair, a sextant, and artif[icial] horizon, a hypsometer with all the thermoms broken, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> I took away the spirit-lamp of it, which I have wanted for sterilizing and making disinfectant lotions of snow. There were also letters there: one from Amundsen to King Haakon, with a request that Scott should send it to him. There was also a list of the five men who made up their party, but no news as to what they had done. I made some sketches here, but it was blowing very cold, −22°. Birdie took some photos. We found no sledge there though they said there was one: it may have been buried in drift. The tent was a funny little thing for 2 men, pegged out with white line and tent-pegs of yellow wood. I took some strips of blue-grey silk off the tent seams: it was perished. The Norskies had got to the Pole on December 16, and were here from 15th to 17th. At our lunch South Pole Camp we saw a sledge-runner with a black flag about ½ mile away blowing from it. Scott sent me on ski to fetch it, and I found a note tied to it showing that this was the Norskies’ actual final Pole position. I was given the flag and the note with Amundsen’s signature, and I got a piece of the sledge-runner as well. The small chart of our wanderings shows best how all these things lie. After lunch we made 6.2 miles from the Pole Camp to the north again, and here we are camped for the night.”<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-306" id="note-306" epub:type="noteref">306</a></p>
					</article>
				</section>
				<p>The following remarks on the South Pole area were written by Bowers in the Meteorological Log, apparently on January 17 and 18:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>“Within 120 miles of the South Pole the sastrugi crossed seem to indicate belts of certain prevalent winds. These were definitely <abbr class="compass">S. E.</abbr>ly. up to about Lat. 78° 0′ <abbr class="compass">S.</abbr>, where the summit was passed and we started to go definitely downhill toward the Pole. An indefinite area was then crossed <abbr class="compass">S. E.</abbr>ly, S.ly and <abbr class="compass">S. E.</abbr>ly sastrugi. Later, in about 79° 0′ <abbr class="compass">S.</abbr>, those from the <abbr class="compass">S. W. W.</abbr> predominated. At this point also the surface of the icecap became affected by undulations running more or less at right angles to our course. These resolved themselves into immense waves some miles in extent,<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-307" id="note-307" epub:type="noteref">307</a> with a uniform surface both in hollow and crust. The whole surface was carpeted with a deposit of ice-crystals which, while we were there, fell sometimes in the form of minute spicules and sometimes in plates. These caused an almost continuous display of parhelia.</p>
					<p>“The flags left a month previously by the Norwegian expedition were practically undamaged and so could not have been exposed to very heavy wind during that time. Their sledging and ski tracks, where marked, were raised slightly, also the dogs’ footprints. In the neighbourhood of their South Pole Camp the drifts were <abbr class="compass">S. W.</abbr>ly, but there was one <abbr class="compass">S. S. E.</abbr> drift to leeward of tent. They had pitched their tent to allow for <abbr class="compass">S. W.</abbr>ly wind. For walking on foot the ground was all pretty soft, and on digging down the crystalline structure of the snow was found to alter very little, and there were no layers of crust such as are found on the Barrier. The snow seems so lightly put together as not to cohere, and makes very little water for its bulk when melted. The constant and varied motion of cirrus, and the forming and motion of radiant points, shows that in the upper atmosphere at this time of the year there is little or no tranquillity.”<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-308" id="note-308" epub:type="noteref">308</a></p>

				<p>That is the bare bones of what was without any possible doubt a great shock. Consider! These men had been out 2½ months and were 800 miles from home. The glacier had been a heavy grind: the plateau certainly not worse, probably better, than was expected, as far as that place where the Last Return Party left them. But then, in addition to a high altitude, a head wind, and a temperature which averaged −18.7°, came this shower of ice-crystals, turning the surface to sand, especially when the sun was out. They were living in cirrus clouds, and the extraordinary state seems to have obtained that the surface of the snow was colder when the sun was shining than when clouds checked the radiation from it. They began to descend. Things began to go not quite right: they felt the cold, especially Oates and Evans: Evans’ hands also were wrong⁠—ever since the seamen made that new sledge. The making of that sledge must have been fiercely cold work: one of the hardest jobs they did. I am not sure that enough notice has been taken of that.</p>
				<p>And then:</p>
				<blockquote data-note="breakout">
					<p>“The Norwegians have forestalled us and are first at the Pole. It is a terrible disappointment, and I am very sorry for my loyal companions. Many thoughts come and much discussion have we had. Tomorrow we must march on to the Pole and then hasten home with all the speed we can compass. All the daydreams must go; it will be a wearisome return.” “The Pole. Yes, but under very different circumstances from those expected … companions labouring on with cold feet and hands. … Evans had such cold hands we camped for lunch … the wind is blowing hard, T. −21°, and there is that curious damp, cold feeling in the air which chills one to the bone in no time. … Great God! this is an awful place. …”<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-309" id="note-309" epub:type="noteref">309</a></p>

				<p>This is not a cry of despair. It is an ejaculation provoked by the ghastly facts. Even now in January the temperature near the South Pole is about 24° lower than it is during the corresponding month of the year (July) near the North Pole,<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-310" id="note-310" epub:type="noteref">310</a> and if it is like this in midsummer, what is it like in midwinter? At the same time it was, with the exception of the sandy surfaces, what they had looked for, and every detail of organization was working out as well as if not better than had been expected.</p>
				<p>Bowers was so busy with the meteorological log and sights which were taken in terribly difficult circumstances that he kept no diary until they started back. Then he wrote on seven consecutive days, as follows:</p>
				<section class="no-header" epub:type="z3998:diary">
					<article epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
						<p>“<i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">January 19.</i> A splendid clear morning with a fine <abbr class="compass">S. W.</abbr> wind blowing. During breakfast time I sewed a flap attachment on to the hood of my green hat so as to prevent the wind from blowing down my neck on the march. We got up the mast and sail on the sledge and headed north, picking up Amundsen’s cairn and our outgoing tracks shortly afterwards. Along these we travelled till we struck the other cairn and finally the black flag where we had made our 58th outward camp. We then with much relief left all traces of the Norwegians behind us, and headed on our own track till lunch camp, when we had covered eight miles.</p>
						<p>“In the afternoon we passed <abbr>No.</abbr> 2 cairn of the British route, and fairly slithered along before a fresh breeze. It was heavy travelling for me, not being on ski, but one does not mind being tired if a good march is made. We did sixteen [miles] altogether for the day, and so should pick up our Last Depôt tomorrow afternoon. The weather became fairly thick soon after noon, and at the end of the afternoon there was considerable drift, with a mist caused by ice-crystals, and parhelion.”</p>

					<article epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
						<p>“<i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">January 20.</i> Good sailing breeze again this morning. It is a great pleasure to have one’s back to the wind instead of having to face it. It came on thicker later, but we sighted the Last Depôt soon after 1 <abbr class="time">p.m.</abbr> and reached it at 1:45 <abbr class="time eoc">p.m.</abbr> The red flag on the bamboo pole was blowing out merrily to welcome us back from the Pole, with its supply of necessaries of life below. We are absolutely dependent upon our depôts to get off the plateau alive, and so welcome the lonely little cairns gladly. At this one, called the Last Depôt, we picked up four days’ food, a can of oil, some methylated spirit (for lighting purposes) and some personal gear we had left there. The bamboo was bent on to the floor-cloth as a yard for our sail instead of a broken sledge-runner of Amundsen’s which we had found at the Pole and made a temporary yard of.</p>
						<p>“As we had marched extra long in the forenoon in order to reach the depôt, our afternoon march was shorter than usual. The wind increased to a moderate gale with heavy gusts and considerable drift. We should have had a bad time had we been facing it. After an hour I had to shift my harness aft so as to control the motions of the sledge. Unfortunately the surface got very sandy latterly, but we finished up with 16.1 miles to our credit and camped in a stiff breeze, which resolved itself into a blizzard a few hours later. I was glad we had our depôt safe.”</p>

					<article epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
						<p>“<i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">January 21.</i> Wind increased to force 8 during night with heavy drift. In the morning it was blizzing like blazes and marching was out of the question. The wind would have been of great assistance to us, but the drift was so thick that steering a course would have been next to impossible. We decided to await developments and get under weigh as soon as it showed any signs of clearing. Fortunately it was shortlived, and instead of lasting the regulation two days it eased up in the afternoon, and 3:45 found us off with our sail full. It was good running on ski but soft plodding for me on foot. I shall be jolly glad to pick up my dear old ski. They are nearly 200 miles away yet, however. The breeze fell altogether latterly and I shifted up into my old place as middle number of the five. Our distance completed was 5.5 miles, when camp was made again. Our old cairns are of great assistance to us, also the tracks, which are obliterated in places by heavy drift and hard sastrugi, but can be followed easily.”</p>

						<p>“<i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">January 22.</i> We came across Evans’ sheepskin boots this morning. They were almost covered up after their long spell since they fell off the sledge [on January 11]. The breeze was fair from the <abbr class="compass">S. S. W.</abbr> but got lighter and lighter. At lunch camp we had completed 8.2 miles. In the afternoon the breeze fell altogether, and the surface, acted on by the sun, became perfect sawdust. The light sledge pulled by five men came along like a drag without a particle of slide or give. We were all glad to camp soon after 7 <abbr class="time eoc">p.m.</abbr> I think we were all pretty tired out. We did altogether 19.5 miles for the day.

In the afternoon it was even stronger, and I had to go back on the sledge and act as guide and brakesman. We had to lower the sail a bit, but even then she ran like a bird.</p>
						<p>“We are picking up our old cairns famously.

						<p>“<i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">January 24.</i> Evans has got his fingers all blistered with frostbites, otherwise we are all well, but thinning, and in spite of our good rations get hungrier daily. I sometimes spend much thought on the march with plans for making a pig of myself on the first opportunity. As that will be after a further march of 700 miles they are a bit premature.</p>
						<p>“It was blowing a gale when we started and it increased in force. Finally with the sail half down, one man detached tracking ahead and Titus and I breaking back, we could not always keep the sledge from overrunning. The blizzard got worse and worse till, having done only seven miles, we had to camp soon after twelve o’clock. We had a most difficult job camping, and it has been blowing like blazes all the afternoon.

						<p>“<i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">January 25.</i> It was no use turning out at our usual time (5:45 <abbr class="time">a.m.</abbr>), as the blizzard was as furious as ever; we therefore decided on a late breakfast and no lunch unless able to march. We have only three days’ food with us and shall be in Queer Street if we miss the depôt. Our bags are getting steadily wetter, so are our clothes. It shows a tendency to clear off now (breakfast time) so, <abbr>d.v.</abbr>, we may march after all. I am in tribulation as regards meals now as we have run out of salt, one of my favourite commodities. It is owing to Atkinson’s party taking back an extra tin by mistake from the Upper Glacier Depôt.

						<p>“10 <abbr class="time">p.m.</abbr>⁠—We have got in a march after all, thank the Lord. Assisted by the wind we made an excellent rundown to our One and a Half Degree Depôt, where the big red flag was blowing out like fury with the breeze, in clouds of driving drift. Here we picked up 1¼ cans of oil and one week’s food for five men, together with some personal gear depôted. We left the bamboo and flag on the cairn. I was much relieved to pick up the depôt: now we only have one other source of anxiety on this endless snow summit, viz. the Three Degree Depôt in latitude 86° 6′ S.</p>
						<p>“In the afternoon we did 5.2 miles. It was a miserable march, blizzard all the time and our sledge either sticking in sastrugi or overrunning the traces. We had to lower the sail half down, and Titus and I hung on to her. It was most strenuous work, as well as much colder than pulling ahead. Most of the time we had to brake back with all our strength to keep the sledge from overrunning. Bill got a bad go of snow glare from following the track without goggles on.</p>

				<p>Wilson was very subject to these attacks of snow blindness, and also to headaches before blizzards. I have an idea that his anxiety to sketch whenever opportunity offered, and his willingness to take off his goggles to search for tracks and cairns, had something to do with it. This attack was very typical.</p>
				<blockquote data-note="breakout">
					<p>“I wrote this at lunch and in the evening had a bad attack of snow blindness.” … “Blizzard in afternoon. We only got in a forenoon march. Couldn’t see enough of the tracks to follow at all. My eyes didn’t begin to trouble me till tomorrow [yesterday], though it was the strain of tracking and the very cold drift which we had today that gave me this attack of snow glare.” … “Marched on foot in the afternoon as my eyes were too bad to go on ski. We had a lot of drift and wind and very cold. Had <abbr class="compound">ZuSO<sub>4</sub></abbr> and cocaine in my eyes at night and didn’t get to sleep at all for the pain⁠—dozed about an hour in the morning only.” … “Marched on foot again all day as I couldn’t see my way on ski at all, Birdie used my ski.

				</blockquote>
				<p>The surface was awful: in his diary of the day after they left the Pole (January 19) Wilson wrote an account of it.</p>
				<blockquote data-note="breakout">
					<p>“We had a splendid wind right behind us most of the afternoon and went well until about 6 <abbr class="time">p.m.</abbr> when the sun came out and we had an awful grind until 7:30 when we camped. The sun comes out on sandy drifts, all on the move in the wind, and <abbr>temp.</abbr> −20°, and gives us an absolutely awful surface with no glide at all for ski or sledge, and just like fine sand. The weather all day has been more or less overcast with white broken altostratus, and for 3 degrees above the horizon there is a grey belt looking like a blizzard of drift, but this in reality is caused by a constant fall of minute snow crystals, very minute. Sometimes instead of crystal plates the fall is of minute agglomerate spicules like tiny sea-urchins. The plates glitter in the sun as though of some size, but you can only just see them as pinpoints on your burberry. So the spicule collections are only just visible. Our hands are never warm enough in camp to do any neat work now. The weather is always uncomfortably cold and windy, about −23°, but after lunch today I got a bit of drawing done.”<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-317" id="note-317" epub:type="noteref">317</a></p>

				<p>All the joy had gone from their sledging. They were hungry, they were cold, the pulling was heavy, and two of them were not fit. As long ago as January 14 Scott wrote that Oates was feeling the cold and fatigue more than the others<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-318" id="note-318" epub:type="noteref">318</a> and again he refers to the matter on January 20.<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-319" id="note-319" epub:type="noteref">319</a> On January 19 Wilson wrote: “We get our hairy faces and mouths dreadfully iced up on the march, and often one’s hands very cold indeed holding ski-sticks. Evans, who cut his knuckle some days ago at the last depôt, has a lot of pus in it tonight.” January 20: “Evans has got 4 or 5 of his fingertips badly blistered by the cold. Titus also his nose and cheeks⁠—al[so] Evans and Bowers.” January 28: “Evans has a number of badly blistered finger-ends which he got at the Pole. Titus’ big toe is turning blue-black.” January 31: “Evans’ fingernails all coming off, very raw and sore.” February 4: “Evans is feeling the cold a lot, always getting frostbitten. Titus’ toes are blackening, and his nose and cheeks are dead yellow. Dressing Evans’ fingers every other day with boric vaseline: they are quite sweet still.” February 5: “Evans’ fingers suppurating. Nose very bad [hard] and rotten-looking.”<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-320" id="note-320" epub:type="noteref">320</a></p>
				<p>Scott was getting alarmed about Evans, who “has dislodged two fingernails tonight; his hands are really bad, and, to my surprise, he shows signs of losing heart over it. He hasn’t been cheerful since the accident.”<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-321" id="note-321" epub:type="noteref">321</a> “The party is not improving in condition, especially Evans, who is becoming rather dull and incapable.” “Evans’ nose is almost as bad as his fingers.

				<p>Bowers’ diary, quoted above, finished on January 25, on which day they picked up their One and a Half Degree Depôt. “I shall sleep much better with our provision bag full again,” wrote Scott that night. “Bowers got another rating sight tonight⁠—it was wonderful how he managed to observe in such a horribly cold wind.” They marched 16 miles the next day, but got off the outward track, which was crooked. On January 27 they did 14 miles on a “very bad surface of deep-cut sastrugi all day, until late in the afternoon when we began to get out of them.”<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-323" id="note-323" epub:type="noteref">323</a> “By Jove, this is tremendous labour,” said Scott.</p>
				<p>They were getting into the better surfaces again: 15.7 miles for January 28, “a fine day and a good march on very decent surface.”<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-324" id="note-324" epub:type="noteref">324</a> On January 29 Bowers wrote his last full day’s diary: “Our record march today. With a good breeze and improving surface we were soon in among the double tracks where the supporting party left us. Then we picked up the memorable camp where I transferred to the advance party. How glad I was to change over. The camp was much drifted up and immense sastrugi were everywhere, <abbr class="compass">S. S. E.</abbr> in direction and <abbr class="compass">S. E.</abbr> We did 10.4 miles before lunch. I was breaking back on sledge and controlling; it was beastly cold and my hands were perished. In the afternoon I put on my dogskin mitts and was far more comfortable. A stiff breeze with drift continues: temperature −25°. Thank God our days of having to face it are over. We completed 19.5 miles [22 statute] this evening, and so are only 29 miles from our precious [Three Degree] Depôt. It will be bad luck indeed if we do not get there in a march and a half anyhow.”<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-325" id="note-325" epub:type="noteref">325</a></p>
				<p>Nineteen miles again on January 30, but during the previous day’s march Wilson had strained a tendon in his leg.</p>
				<blockquote data-note="breakout">
					<p>“I got a nasty bruise on the Tib[ialis] ant[icus] which gave me great pain all the afternoon.” “My left leg exceedingly painful all day, so I gave Birdie my ski and hobbled alongside the sledge on foot. The whole of the Tibialis anticus is swollen and tight, and full of teno synovitis, and the skin red and oedematous over the shin. But we made a very fine march with the help of a brisk breeze.”</p>

				<p>January 31:</p>
				<blockquote data-note="breakout">
					<p>“Again walking by the sledge with swollen leg but not nearly so painful. We had 5.8 miles to go to reach our Three Degree Depôt. Picked this up with a week’s provision and a line from Evans, and then for lunch an extra biscuit each, making 4 for lunch and ⅒ whack of butter extra as well. Afternoon we passed cairn where Birdie’s ski had been left. These we picked up and came on till 7:30 <abbr class="time">p.m.</abbr> when the wind which had been very light all day dropped, and with <abbr>temp.</abbr> −20° it felt delightfully warm and sunny and clear.

				<p>They were now approaching the crevassed surfaces and the icefalls which mark the entrance to the Beardmore Glacier, and February 2 was marked by another accident, this time to Scott.</p>
				<blockquote data-note="breakout">
					<p>“On a very slippery surface I came an awful ‘purler’ on my shoulder.

				<p>They had been spending some time in finding the old tracks. But they had a good landfall for the depôt at the top of the glacier and on February 3 they decided to push on due north, and to worry no more for the present about tracks and cairns. They did 16 miles that day. Wilson’s diary runs:</p>

Those nearer the crest were the ordinary broad street-like crevasses, well lidded.

				<p>This was the end of the plateau: the beginning of the glacier. Their hard time should be over so far as the weather was concerned. Wilson notes how fine the land looked as they approached it: “The colour of the Dominion Range rock is in the main all brown madder or dark reddish chocolate, but there are numerous bands of yellow rock scattered amongst it.

				<p>The condition of the party was of course giving anxiety: how much it is impossible to say. A good deal was to be hoped from the warm weather ahead. Scott and Bowers were probably the fittest men. Scott’s shoulder soon mended and “Bowers is splendid, full of energy and bustle all the time.”<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-332" id="note-332" epub:type="noteref">332</a> Wilson was feeling the cold more than either of them now. His leg was not yet well enough to wear ski. Oates had suffered from a cold foot for some time. Evans, however, was the only man whom Scott seems to have been worried about.</p>

				<p>There are no germs in the Antarctic, save for a few isolated specimens which almost certainly come down from civilization in the upper air currents. You can sleep all night in a wet bag and clothing, and sledge all day in a mail of ice, and you will not catch a cold nor get any aches. You can get deficiency diseases, like scurvy, for inland this is a deficiency country, without vitamines. You can also get poisoned if you allow your food to remain thawed out too long, and if you do not cover the provisions in a depôt with enough snow the sun will get at them, even though the air temperature is far below freezing. But it is not easy to become diseased.</p>
				<p>On the other hand, once something does go wrong it is the deuce and all to get it right: especially cuts. And the isolation of the polar traveller may place him in most difficult circumstances. There are no ambulances and hospitals, and a man on a sledge is a very serious weight. Practically any man who undertakes big polar journeys must face the possibility of having to commit suicide to save his companions, and the difficulty of this must not be overrated, for it is in some ways more desirable to die than to live if things are bad enough: we got to that stage on the Winter Journey. I remember discussing this question with Bowers, who had a scheme of doing himself in with a pickaxe if necessity arose, though how he could have accomplished it I don’t know: or, as he said, there might be a crevasse and at any rate there was the medical case. I was horrified at the time: I had never faced the thing out with myself like that.</p>
				<p>They left the Upper Glacier Depôt under Mount Darwin on February 8. This day they collected the most important of those geological specimens to which, at Wilson’s special request, they clung to the end, and which were mostly collected by him. Mount Darwin and Buckley Island, which are really the tops of high mountains, stick out of the ice at the top of the glacier, and the course ran near to both of them, but not actually up against them. Shackleton found coal on Buckley Island, and it was clear that the place was of great geological importance, for it was one of the only places in the Antarctic where fossils could be found, so far as we knew. The icefalls stretched away as far as you could see towards the mountains which bound the glacier on either side, and as you looked upwards towards Buckley Island they were like a long breaking wave. One of the great difficulties about the Beardmore was that you saw the icefalls as you went up, and avoided them, but coming down you knew nothing of their whereabouts until you fell into the middle of pressure and crevasses, and then it was almost impossible to say whether you should go right or left to get out.</p>
				<p>Evans was unable to pull this day, and was detached from the sledge, but this was not necessarily a very serious sign: Shackleton on his return journey was not able to pull at this place. Wilson wrote as follows:</p>

				<p>Meanwhile both Wilson and Bowers had been badly snow-blind, though Wilson does not mention it in his diary; and this night Scott says Evans had no power to assist with camping work. A good march followed on February 14, but:</p>
				<blockquote data-note="breakout">
					<p>“There is no getting away from the fact that we are not pulling strong. Probably none of us: Wilson’s leg still troubles him and he doesn’t like to trust himself on ski; but the worst case is Evans, who is giving us serious anxiety. This morning he suddenly disclosed a huge blister on his foot. It delayed us on the march, when he had to have his crampon readjusted. Sometimes I feel he is going from bad to worse, but I trust he will pick up again when we come to steady work on ski like this afternoon. He is hungry and so is Wilson. We can’t risk opening out our food again, and as cook at present I am serving something under full allowance. We are inclined to get slack and slow with our camping arrangement, and small delays increase. I have talked of the matter tonight and hope for improvement. We cannot do distance without the hours.”<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-338" id="note-338" epub:type="noteref">338</a></p>

				<p>There was something wrong with this party: more wrong, I mean, than was justified by the tremendous journey they had already experienced. Except for the blizzard at the bottom of the Beardmore and the surfaces near the Pole it had been little worse than they expected. Evans, however, who was considered by Scott to be the strongest man of the party, had already collapsed, and it is admitted that the rest of the party was becoming far from strong. There seems to be an unknown factor here somewhere.</p>

						<p>“<i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">February 17.</i> The weather cleared and we got away for a clear run to the depôt and had gone a good part of the way when Evans found his ski shoes coming off. He was allowed to readjust and continue to pull, but it happened again, and then again, so he was told to unhitch, get them right, and follow on and catch us up. He lagged far behind till lunch, and when we camped we had lunch, and then went back for him as he had not come up. He had fallen and had his hands frostbitten, and we then returned for the sledge, and brought it, and fetched him in on it as he was rapidly losing the use of his legs. He was comatose when we got him into the tent, and he died without recovering consciousness that night about 10 <abbr class="time eoc">p.m.</abbr> We had a short rest for an hour or two in our bags that night, then had a meal and came on through the pressure ridges about 4 miles farther down and reached our Lower Glacier Depôt.

Wilson thinks it certain he must have injured his brain by a fall. It is a terrible thing to lose a companion in this way, but calm reflection shows that there could not have been a better ending to the terrible anxieties of the past week. Discussion of the situation at lunch yesterday shows us what a desperate pass we were in with a sick man on our hands at such a distance from home.”<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-340" id="note-340" epub:type="noteref">340</a></p>
