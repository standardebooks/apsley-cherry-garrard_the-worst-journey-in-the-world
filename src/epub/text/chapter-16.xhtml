					<p><i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">October 28. Hut Point.</i> A beautiful day. We finished digging out the stable for the mules this morning and brought in some blubber this afternoon. The Bluff has its cap on, but otherwise the sky is nearly clear: there is a little cumulus between White Island and the Bluff, the first I have seen this year on the Barrier. It is most noticeable how much snow has disappeared off the rocks and shingle here.</p>

Hut Point.</i> The mule party, under Wright, consisting of Gran, Nelson, Crean, Hooper, Williamson, Keohane and Lashly, left Cape Evans at 10:30 and arrived here at 5 <abbr>p.m.</abbr> after a good march in perfect weather. They leave Debenham and Archer at the hut, and I am afraid it will be dull work for them the next three months. Archer turned out early and made some cakes which they have brought with them. They camped for lunch seven miles from Cape Evans.</p>

					</figure>
					<p>This is the start of the Search Journey. Everything which forethought can do has been done, and to a point twelve miles south of Corner Camp the mules will be travelling light owing to the depots which have been laid. The barometer has been falling the last few days and is now low, while the Bluff is overcast. Yet it does not look like blizzard to come. Two Adélie penguins, the first, came to Cape Evans yesterday, and a skua was seen there on the 24th: so summer is really here.</p>

					<p><i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">October 30. Hut Point.</i> It is now 8 <abbr>p.m.</abbr>, and the mules are just off, looking very fit, keeping well together, and giving no trouble at the start. Their leaders turned in this afternoon, and tonight begins the new routine of night marching, just the same as last year. It did look thick on the Barrier this afternoon, and it was quite a question whether it was advisable for them to start. But it is rolling away now, being apparently only fog, which is now disappearing before some wind, or perhaps because the sun is losing its power. I think they will have a good march.</p>

					<p><i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">November 2</i>, 5 <abbr>a.m.</abbr> <i>Biscuit Depot.</i> Atkinson, Dimitri and I, with two dog-teams, left Hut Point last night at 8:30. We have had a coldish night’s run, −21° when we left after lunch, −17° now. The surface was very heavy for the dogs, there being a soft coating of snow over everything since we last came this way, due no doubt to the foggy days we have been having lately. The sledge-meter makes it nearly 16 miles.</p>
					<p>The mule party has two days’ start on us, and their programme is to do twelve miles a day to One Ton Depot. Their tracks are fairly clear, but there has been some drift from the east since they passed. We picked up our cairns well. We are pretty wet, having been running nearly all the way.</p>

				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
					<p><i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">November 3.</i> Early morning. 14½ miles. We are here at Corner Camp, but not without a struggle. We left the Biscuit Depot at 6:30 <abbr>p.m.</abbr> yesterday, and it is now 4 <abbr class="eoc">a.m.</abbr> The last six miles took us four hours, which is very bad going for dogs, and we have all been running most of the way. The surface was very bad, crusty and also soft: it was blowing with some low drift, and overcast and snowing. We followed the drifted-up mule tracks with difficulty and are lucky to have got so far. The temperature has been a constant zero.</p>
					<p>There is a note here from Wright about the mules, which left here last night. They only saw two small crevasses on the way, but Khan Sahib got into the tide-crack at the edge of the Barrier, and had to be hauled out with a rope. The mules are going fast over the first part of the day, but show a tendency to stop towards the end: they keep well together except Khan Sahib, who is a slower mule than the others. It is now blowing with some drift, but nothing bad, and beyond the Bluff it seems to be clear. We are all pretty tired.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
					<p><i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">November 4. Early morning.</i> Well! this has been a disappointing day, but we must hope that all will turn out well. We turned out at 2 <abbr>a.m.</abbr> yesterday and then it was clearing all round, a mild blizzard having been blowing since we camped. We started at five in some wind and low drift. It was good travelling weather, and except for the first three miles the surface has been fair to good, and the last part very good. Yet the dogs could not manage their load, which according to programme should go up a further 150 <abbr>lbs.</abbr> each team here at Dimitri Depot. One of our dogs, Kusoi, gave out, but we managed to get him along tied to the stern of the sledge, because the team behind tried to get at him and he realized he had better mend his ways. We camped for lunch when Tresor also was pretty well done. We were then on a very good surface, but were often pushing the sledge to get it along. The mule party were gone when we started again, and probably did not see us. We came on to the depot, but we cannot hope to get along far on bad surfaces if we cannot get along on good ones. The note left by Wright states that their sledge-meter has proved useless, and this leaves all three parties of us with only one, which is not very reliable now.</p>
					<p>So it has been decided that the dogs must return from 80° 0′, or 81° at the farthest, and instead of four mules, as was intended, going on from there, five must go on instead. The dogs can therefore now leave behind much of their own weights and take on the mules’ weights instead. And this is the part where the mules’ weights are so heavy. Perhaps the new scheme is the best, but it puts everything on the mules from 80° 0′: if they will do it all is well: if they won’t we have nothing to fall back on.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
					<p><i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">Midnight, November 4⁠–⁠5.</i> It has been blowing and drifting all day. We turned out again at midday on the 4th, and remade the depot with what we were to leave owing to the new programme. This is all rather sad, but it can’t be helped. It was then blowing a summer blizzard, and we were getting frostbitten when we started, following the mule tracks. There were plenty of cairns for us to pick up, and with the lighter loads and a very good surface we came along much better. Lunching at eight miles we arrived just as the mule party had finished their hoosh preparatory to starting, and it has been decided that the mules are not to go on tonight, but we will all start marching together tomorrow.</p>
					<p>The news from this party is on the whole good, not the least good being that the sledge-meter is working again, though not very reliably. They are marching well, and at a great pace, except for Khan Sahib. Gulab, however, is terribly chafed both by his collar and by his breast harness, both of which have been tried. He has a great raw place where this fits on one side, and is chafed, but not so badly, on the other side. Lal Khan is pulling well, but is eating very little. Pyaree is doing very well, but has some difficulty in lifting her leg when in soft snow. Abdullah seems to be considered the best mule at present. On the whole good hearing.</p>
					<p>Wright’s sleeping-bag is bad, letting in light through cracks in a good many places. But he makes very little of it and does not seem to be cold⁠—saying it is good ventilation. The mule cloths, which have a rough lining to their outside canvas, are collecting a lot of snow, and all the mules are matted with cakes of snow. They are terrible rope-eaters, cloth-eaters, anything to eat, though they are not hungry. And they have even learnt to pull their picketing buckles undone, and go walking about the camp. Indeed Nelson says that the only time when Khan Sahib does not cast himself adrift is when he is ready to start on the march.</p>

				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
					<p><i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">November 6. Early morning.</i> We had a really good lie-in yesterday, and after the hard slogging with the dogs during the last few days I for one was very glad of it. We came on behind, and in sight of the mules this last march, and the change in the dogs was wonderful. Where it had been a job to urge them on over quite as good a surface yesterday, today for some time we could not get off the sledge except for short runs: although we had taken 312 <abbr>lbs.</abbr> weight off the mules and loaded it on to the dogs.</p>
					<p>We had a most glorious night for marching, and it is now bright sunlight, and the animals’ fur is quite warm where the sun strikes it. We have just had a bit of a fight over the dog-food, Vaida going for Dyk, and now the others are somewhat excited, and there are constant growlings and murmurings.</p>
					<p>The camp makes more of a mark than last year, for the mules are dark while the ponies were white or grey, and the cloths are brown instead of light green. The consequence is that the camp shows up from a long distance off. We are building cairns at regular distances, and there should be no difficulty in keeping on the course in fair weather at any rate. Now in the land of big sastrugi: Erebus is beginning to look small, but we could see an unusually big smoke from the crater all day.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
					<p><i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">November 7. Early morning.</i> Not an easy day. It was −9° and overcast when we turned out, and the wind was then dying down, but it had been blowing up to force 5, with surface drift during the day. We started in a bad light and the surface, which was the usual hard surface common here, with big sastrugi, was covered by a thin layer of crystals which were then falling. This naturally made it very much harder pulling: we with the dogs have been running nearly all the twelve miles, and I for one am tired. At lunch Atkinson thought he saw a tent away to our right⁠—the very thought of it came as a shock⁠—but it proved to be a false alarm. We have been keeping a sharp lookout for the gear which was left about this part by the Last Return Party, but have seen no sign of it.</p>
					<p>It is now −14°, but the sun is shining brightly in a clear sky, and it feels beautifully warm. It seems a very regular thing for the sky to cloud over as the sun gets low towards nightfall⁠—and directly the sun begins to rise again the clouds disappear in a most wonderful way.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
					<p><i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">November 8. Early morning.</i> Last night’s twelve miles was quite cold for the time of year, being −23° at lunch and now −18°. But it is calm, with bright sun, and this temperature feels warm. However, there are some frostbites as a result, both Nelson and Hooper having swollen faces. The same powder and crystals have been on the surface, but we have carried the good Bluff surface so far, being now four miles beyond Bluff Depot. This is fortunate, and to the best of my recollection we were already getting on to a soft surface at this point last summer. If so there must have been more wind here this year than last, which, according to the winter we have had, seems probable.</p>
					<p>We made up the Bluff Depot after lunch, putting up a new flag and building up the cairn, leaving two cases of dog-biscuit for the returning dog-teams. It is curious that the drift to leeward of the cairn, that is <abbr epub:type="se:compass">N. N. E.</abbr>, was quite soft, the snow all round and the drifts on either side being hard⁠—exceptionally hard in fact. Why this drift should remain soft when a drift in the same place is usually hard is difficult to explain. All is happy in the mule camp. They have given Lal a drink of water and he has started to eat, which is good news. Some of the mules seem snow-blind, and they are now all wearing their blinkers. I have just heard that Gran swung the thermometer at four this morning and found it −29°. Nelson’s face is a sight⁠—his nose a mere swollen lump, frostbitten cheeks, and his goggles have frosted him where the rims touched his face. Poor Marie!</p>

				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
					<p><i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">November 9. Early morning.</i> Twelve more miles to the good, and we must consider ourselves fortunate in still carrying on the same good surface, which is almost if not quite as good as that of yesterday. This is the only time I have ever seen a hard surface here, not more than fifteen miles from One Ton, and it looks as if there had been much higher winds. The sastrugi, which have been facing <abbr epub:type="se:compass">S. W.</abbr>, are now beginning to run a little more westerly. I believe this to be quite a different wind circulation from Ross Island, which as a whole gets its wind from the Bluff. The Bluff is, I believe, the dividing line, though big general blizzards sweep over the whole, irrespective of local areas of circulation. This was amply corroborated by our journey out here last autumn. Well, this is better than then⁠—just round here we had a full blizzard and −33°.</p>

				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
					<p><i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">November 10. Early morning.</i> A perfect night for marching, but about −20° and chilly for waiting about. The mules are going well, but Lal Khan is thinning down a lot: Abdullah and Khan Sahib are also off their feed. Their original allowance of 11 <abbr>lbs.</abbr> oats and oil-cake has been reduced to 9 <abbr>lbs.</abbr>, and they are not eating this. The dogs took another 300 <abbr>lbs.</abbr> off them today, and pulled it very well. The surface has been splendidly hard, which is most surprising. Wright does not think that there has been an abnormal deposition of snow the last winter; he says it is about 1½ feet, which is much the same as last year. The mules are generally not sinking in more than two inches, but in places, especially latterly, they have been in five, or six. This is the first we have had this year of crusts, and some of them today have been exceptionally big: two at lunch must have lasted several seconds. The dogs seem to think the devil is after them when one of these goes off, and put on a terrific spurt. It is interesting to watch them snuffing in the hoof-marks of the mules, where there is evidently some scent left. In these temperatures they are always kicking their legs about at the halts. As the sun gained power this morning a thick fog came up very suddenly. I believe this is a sign of good weather.</p>

					<p><i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">November 11. Early morning. One Ton Depot.</i> Wright got a latitude sight yesterday putting us six miles from One Ton, and our sledge-meter shows 5¾, and here we are. More frostbite this morning, and it was pretty cold starting in a fair wind and −7° temperature. We have continued this really splendid surface, and now the sastrugi are pointing a little more to the south of <abbr epub:type="se:compass">S. W.</abbr> While there are not such big mounds, the surface does not yet show any signs of getting bad. There were the most beautiful cloud-effects as we came along⁠—a deep black to the west, shading into long lines of grey and lemon yellow round the sun, with a vertical shaft through them, and a bright orange horizon. Now there is a brilliant parhelion. Given sun, two days here are never alike. Whatever the monotony of the Barrier may be, there is endless variety in the sky, and I do not believe that anywhere in the world such beautiful colours are to be seen.</p>
					<p>I had a fair panic as we came up to the depot. I did not see that one body of the ponies had gone ahead of the others and camped, but ahead of the travelling ponies was the depot, looking very black, and I thought that there was a tent. It would be too terrible to find that, though one knew that we had done all that we could, if we had done something different we could have saved them.</p>
					<p>And then we find that the provisions we left here for them in the tank are soaked with paraffin. How this has happened is a mystery, but I think that the oil in the XS tin, which was very full, must have forced its way out in a sudden rise of temperature in a winter blizzard, and though the tin was not touching the tank, it has found its way in.</p>
					<p>Altogether things seemed rather dismal, but a visit to the mules is cheering, for they seem very fit as a whole and their leaders are cheerful. There are three sacks of oats here⁠—had we known it would have saved a lot of weight⁠—but we didn’t, and we have plenty with what we have brought, so they will be of little use to us. There is no compressed fodder, which would have been very useful, for the animals which are refusing the oats would probably eat it.</p>
					<p>Gulab has a very bad chafe, but he is otherwise fit⁠—and it does not seem possible in this life to kill a mule because of chafing. It is a great deal to know that he does not seem to be hurt by it, and pulls away gallantly. Crean says he had to run a mile this morning with Rani. Marie says he is inventing some new ways of walking, one step forward and one hop back, in order to keep warm when leading Khan Sahib. Up to date we cannot say that the Fates have been unkind to us.</p>

					<p><i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">November 12. Early morning. Lunch 2:30 <abbr class="eoc">a.m.</abbr></i> I am afraid our sledge-meters do not agree over this morning’s march. The programme is to do thirteen miles a day if possible from here: that is 7½ before lunch and 5½ afterwards. We could see two cairns of last year on our right as we came along. We have got on to a softer surface now and there is bad news of Lal Khan, and it will depend on this after-lunch march whether he must be shot this evening or not. It was intended to shoot a mule two marches from One Ton, but till just lately it had not been thought that it must be Lal Khan. He is getting very slow, and came into camp with Khan Sahib: the trouble of course is that he will not eat: he has hardly eaten, they say, a day’s ration since he left Hut Point, and he can’t work on nothing. It is now −16°, with a slight southerly wind.</p>
					<p><i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">Nearly midday. 11⁠–⁠12 miles south of One Ton.</i> We have found them⁠—to say it has been a ghastly day cannot express it⁠—it is too bad for words. The tent was there, about half-a-mile to the west of our course, and close to a drifted-up cairn of last year. It was covered with snow and looked just like a cairn, only an extra gathering of snow showing where the ventilator was, and so we found the door.</p>
					<p>It was drifted up some 2⁠–⁠3 feet to windward. Just by the side two pairs of ski sticks, or the topmost half of them, appeared over the snow, and a bamboo which proved to be the mast of the sledge.</p>
					<p>Their story I am not going to try and put down. They got to this point on March 21, and on the 29th all was over.</p>
					<p>Nor will I try and put down what there was in that tent. Scott lay in the centre, Bill on his left, with his head towards the door, and Birdie on his right, lying with his feet towards the door.</p>
					<p>Bill especially had died very quietly with his hands folded over his chest. Birdie also quietly.</p>
					<p>Oates’ death was a very fine one. We go on tomorrow to try and find his body. He was glad that his regiment would be proud of him.</p>
					<p>They reached the Pole a month after Amundsen.</p>
					<p>We have everything⁠—records, diaries, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> They have among other things several rolls of photographs, a meteorological log kept up to March 13, and, considering all things, a great many geological specimens. <em>And they have stuck to everything.</em> It is magnificent that men in such case should go on pulling everything that they have died to gain. I think they realized their coming end a long time before. By Scott’s head was tobacco: there is also a bag of tea.</p>
					<p>Atkinson gathered everyone together and read to them the account of Oates’ death given in Scott’s Diary: Scott expressly states that he wished it known. His (Scott’s) last words are:</p>
					<p>“For God’s sake take care of our people.”</p>
					<p>Then Atkinson read the lesson from the Burial Service from Corinthians. Perhaps it has never been read in a more magnificent cathedral and under more impressive circumstances⁠—for it is a grave which kings must envy. Then some prayers from the Burial Service: and there with the floor-cloth under them and the tent above we buried them in their sleeping-bags⁠—and surely their work has not been in vain.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-291" id="noteref-291" epub:type="noteref">291</a></p>

			</section>
			<p>That scene can never leave my memory. We with the dogs had seen Wright turn away from the course by himself and the mule party swerve right-handed ahead of us. He had seen what he thought was a cairn, and then something looking black by its side. A vague kind of wonder gradually gave way to a real alarm. We came up to them all halted. Wright came across to us. “It is the tent.” I do not know how he knew. Just a waste of snow: to our right the remains of one of last year’s cairns, a mere mound: and then three feet of bamboo sticking quite alone out of the snow: and then another mound, of snow, perhaps a trifle more pointed. We walked up to it. I do not think we quite realized⁠—not for very long⁠—but someone reached up to a projection of snow, and brushed it away. The green flap of the ventilator of the tent appeared, and we knew that the door was below.</p>
			<p>Two of us entered, through the funnel of the outer tent, and through the bamboos on which was stretched the lining of the inner tent. There was some snow⁠—not much⁠—between the two linings. But inside we could see nothing⁠—the snow had drifted out the light. There was nothing to do but to dig the tent out. Soon we could see the outlines. There were three men here.</p>
			<p>Bowers and Wilson were sleeping in their bags. Scott had thrown back the flaps of his bag at the end. His left hand was stretched over Wilson, his lifelong friend. Beneath the head of his bag, between the bag and the floor-cloth, was the green wallet in which he carried his diary. The brown books of diary were inside: and on the floor-cloth were some letters.</p>
			<p>Everything was tidy. The tent had been pitched as well as ever, with the door facing down the sastrugi, the bamboos with a good spread, the tent itself taut and shipshape. There was no snow inside the inner lining. There were some loose pannikins from the cooker, the ordinary tent gear, the personal belongings and a few more letters and records⁠—personal and scientific. Near Scott was a lamp formed from a tin and some lamp wick off a finnesko. It had been used to burn the little methylated spirit which remained. I think that Scott had used it to help him to write up to the end. I feel sure that he had died last⁠—and once I had thought that he would not go so far as some of the others. We never realized how strong that man was, mentally and physically, until now.</p>
			<p>We sorted out the gear, records, papers, diaries, spare clothing, letters, chronometers, finnesko, socks, a flag. There was even a book which I had lent Bill for the journey⁠—and he had brought it back. Somehow we learnt that Amundsen had been to the Pole, and that they too had been to the Pole, and both items of news seemed to be of no importance whatever. There was a letter there from Amundsen to King Haakon. There were the personal chatty little notes we had left for them on the Beardmore⁠—how much more important to us than all the royal letters in the world.</p>
			<p>We dug down the bamboo which had brought us to this place. It led to the sledge, many feet down, and had been rigged there as a mast. And on the sledge were some more odds and ends⁠—a piece of paper from the biscuit box: Bowers’ meteorological log: and the geological specimens, thirty pounds of them, all of the first importance. Drifted over also were the harnesses, ski and ski-sticks.</p>
			<p>Hour after hour, so it seemed to me, Atkinson sat in our tent and read. The finder was to read the diary and then it was to be brought home⁠—these were Scott’s instructions written on the cover. But Atkinson said he was only going to read sufficient to know what had happened⁠—and after that they were brought home unopened and unread. When he had the outline we all gathered together and he read to us the Message to the Public, and the account of Oates’ death, which Scott had expressly wished to be known.</p>
			<p>We never moved them. We took the bamboos of the tent away, and the tent itself covered them. And over them we built the cairn.</p>
			<p>I do not know how long we were there, but when all was finished, and the chapter of Corinthians had been read, it was midnight of some day. The sun was dipping low above the Pole, the Barrier was almost in shadow. And the sky was blazing⁠—sheets and sheets of iridescent clouds. The cairn and Cross stood dark against a glory of burnished gold.</p>

					<p><i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">Midnight, November 12⁠–⁠13.</i> I cannot think that anything which could be done to give these three great men⁠—for great they were⁠—a fitting grave has been left undone.</p>
					<p>A great cairn has been built over them, a mark which must last for many years. That we can make anything that will be permanent on this Barrier is impossible, but as far as a lasting mark can be made it has been done. On this a cross has been fixed, made out of ski. On either side are the two sledges, fixed upright and dug in.</p>
					<p>The whole is very simple and most impressive.</p>
					<p>On a bamboo standing by itself is left the record which I have copied into this book, and which has been signed by us all.</p>
					<p>We shall leave some provisions here, and go on lightly laden to see if we can find Titus Oates’ body: and so give it what burial we can.</p>
					<p>We start in about an hour, and I for one shall be glad to leave this place.</p>
					<p>I am very very sorry that this question of the shortage of oil has arisen. We in the First Return Party were most careful with our measurement⁠—having a ruler of Wright’s and a piece of bamboo with which we did it: measuring the total height of oil in each case, and then dividing up the stick accordingly with the ruler: and we were <em>always</em> careful to take <em>a little less than we were entitled to</em>, which was stated to me, and stated by Birdie in his depot notes, to be one-third of everything in the depot.</p>
					<p>How the shortage arose is a mystery. And they eleven miles from One Ton and plenty!</p>
					<p>Titus did not show his foot till about three days before he died. The foot was then a great size, and almost every night it would be frostbitten again. Then the last day at lunch he said he could go on no more⁠—but they said he must: he wanted them to leave him behind in his bag. That night he turned in, hoping never to wake: but he woke, and then he asked their advice: they said they must all go on together. A thick blizzard was blowing, and he said, after a bit, “Well, I am just going outside, and I may be some time.” They searched for him but could not find him.</p>
					<p>They had a terrible time from 80° 0′ on to their last camp. There Bill was very bad, and Birdie and the Owner had to do the camping.</p>
					<p>And then, eleven miles from plenty, they had <em>nine days of blizzard, and that was the end</em>.</p>
					<p>They had a good spread on their tent, and their ski-sticks were standing, but their ski were drifted up on the ground.</p>
					<p>The tent was in excellent condition⁠—only down some of the poles there were some chafes.</p>
					<p>They had been trying a spirit lamp when all the oil was gone.</p>
					<p>At 88° or so they were getting temperatures from −20° to −30°. At 82°, 10,000 feet lower, it was regularly down to −47° in the nighttime, and −30° during the day: for no explainable reason.</p>
					<p>Bill’s and Birdie’s feet got bad⁠—the Owner’s feet got bad last.</p>
					<p>It is all too horrible⁠—I am almost afraid to go to sleep now.</p>

					<p><i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">November 13. Early morning.</i> We came on just under seven miles with a very cold moist wind hurting our faces all the way. We have left most of the provisions to pick up again. We purpose going on thirteen miles tomorrow and search for Oates’ body, and then turn back and get the provisions back to Hut Point and see what can be done over in the west to get up that coast.</p>
					<p>We hope to get two mules back to Hut Point. If possible, we want to communicate with Cape Evans.</p>
					<p>Atkinson has been quite splendid in this very trying time.</p>

					<p><i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">November 14. Early morning.</i> It has been a miserable march. We had to wait some time after hoosh to let the mules get ahead. Then we went on in a cold raw fog and some head wind, with constant frostbites. The surface has been very bad all day for the thirteen miles: if we had been walking in arrowroot it would have been much like this was. At lunch the temperature was −14.7°.</p>
					<p>Then on when it was drifting with the wind in our faces and in a bad light. What we took to be the mule party ahead proved to be the old pony walls 26 miles from One Ton. There was here a bit of sacking on the cairn, and Oates’ bag. Inside the bag was the theodolite, and his finnesko and socks. One of the finnesko was slit down the front as far as the leather beckets, evidently to get his bad foot into it. This was fifteen miles from the last camp, and I suppose they had brought on his bag for three or four miles in case they might find him still alive. Half-a-mile from our last camp there was a very large and quite unmistakable undulation, one-quarter to one-third of a mile from crest to crest: the pony walls behind us disappeared almost as soon as we started to go down, and reappeared again on the other side. There were, I feel sure, other rolls, but this was the largest. We have seen no sign of Oates’ body.</p>
					<p>About half an hour ago it started to blow a blizzard, and it is now thick, but the wind is not strong. The mules, which came along well considering the surface, are off their feed, and this may be the reason.</p>
					<p>Dimitri saw the Cairn with the Cross more than eight miles away this morning, and in a good light it would be seen from much farther off.</p>

				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
					<p><i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">November 15. Early morning.</i> We built a cairn to mark the spot near which Oates walked out to his death, and we placed a cross on it. Lashed to the cross is a record, as follows:</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>Hereabouts died a very gallant gentleman, Captain <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">L. E. G.</abbr> Oates of the Inniskilling Dragoons. In March 1912, returning from the Pole, he walked willingly to his death in a blizzard to try and save his comrades, beset by hardship. This note is left by the Relief Expedition. 1912.</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>This was signed by Atkinson and myself.</p>
					<p>We saw the cairn for a long way in a bad light as we came back today.</p>
					<p>The original plan with which we started from Cape Evans was, if the Party was found where we could still bear out sufficiently to the eastward to have a good chance of missing the pressure caused by the Beardmore, to go on and do what we could to survey the land south of the Beardmore: for this was the original plan of Captain Scott for this year’s sledging. But as things are I do not think there can be much doubt that we are doing right in losing no time in going over to the west of McMurdo Sound to see whether we can go up to Evans Coves, and help Campbell and his party.</p>
					<p>We brought on Oates’ bag. The theodolite was inside.</p>
					<p>A thickish blizzard blew all day yesterday, but it was clear and there was only surface drift when we turned out for the night march. Then again as we came along, the sky became overcast⁠—all except over the land, which remains clear these nights when everything else is obscured. We noticed the same thing last year. Now the wind, which had largely dropped, has started again and it is drifting. We have had wind and drift on four out of the last five days.</p>

				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
					<p><i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">November 16. Early morning.</i> When we were ready to start with the dogs it was blowing a thick blizzard, but the mules had already started some time, when it was not thick. We had to wait until nearly 4 <abbr>a.m.</abbr> before we could start, and came along following tracks. It is very warm and the surface is covered with loose snow, but the slide in it seems good. We found the mules here at the Cairn and Cross, having been able to find their way partly by the old tracks.</p>
					<p>I have been trying to draw the grave. Of all the fine monuments in the world none seems to me more fitting; and it is also most impressive.</p>

				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
					<p><i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">November 17. Early morning.</i> I think we are all going crazy together⁠—at any rate things are pretty difficult. The latest scheme is to try and find a way over the plateau to Evans Coves, trying to strike the top of a glacier and go down it. There can be no good in it: if ever men did it, they would arrive about the time the ship arrived there too, and their labour would be in vain. If they got there and the ship did not arrive, there is another party stranded. They would have to wait till February 15 or 20 to see if the ship was coming, and then there would be no travelling back over the plateau: even if we could do it those men there could not.</p>
					<p>It was almost oppressively hot yesterday⁠—but I’ll never grumble about heat again. It has now cleared a lot and we came along on the cairns easily⁠—but on a very soft downy surface, and the travelling has not been fast. We bring with us the Southern Party’s gear. The sledge, which was the 10-foot which they brought on from the bottom of the glacier, has been left.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
					<p><i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">November 18. Early morning.</i> I am thankful to say that the plateau journey idea has been given up.</p>
					<p>Once more we have come along in thick, snowy weather. If we had not men on ski to steer we could never keep much of a course, but Wright is steering us very straight, keeping a check on the course by watching the man behind, and so far we have been picking up all the cairns. This morning we passed the pony walls made on November 10. And yet they were nearly level with the ground; so they are not much of a mark. Yank has just had a disagreement with Kusoi⁠—for Kusoi objected to his trying to get at the meat on the sledge. The mules have been sinking in a long way, and are marching very slowly. Pyaree eats the tea leaves after meals: Rani and Abdullah divide a rope between them at the halts; and they have eaten the best part of a trace since our last camp. These animals eat anything but their proper food, and this some of them will hardly touch.</p>
					<p>It cleared a bit for our second march, and we have done our 13 miles, but it was very slow travelling. Now it is drifting as much as ever. Yank, that redoubtable puller, has just eaten himself loose for the third time since hoosh. This time I had to go down to the pony walls to get him.</p>
					<p>We have had onions for the first time tonight in our hoosh⁠—they are most excellent. Also we have been having some Nestlé’s condensed milk from One Ton Depot⁠—which I do not want to see again, the depot I mean. Peary must know what he is about, taking milk as a ration: the sweetness is a great thing, but it would be heavy: we have been having it with temperature down to −14°, when it was quite manageable, but I don’t know what it would be like in colder temperatures.</p>

				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
					<p><i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">November 19. Early morning.</i> We have done our 13 miles today and have got on to a much better surface. By what we and others have seen before, it seems that last winter must have generally been an exceptional one. There have been many parties out here: we have never before seen this windswept surface, on which it is often too slippery to walk comfortably. I do not know what temperatures the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Discovery</i> had in April, but it was much colder last April than it was the year before. And then nothing had been experienced down here to compare with the winds last winter.</p>
					<p>There was a high wind and a lot of drift yesterday during the day, and now it is blowing and drifting as usual. During the last nine days there has only been one, the day we found the tent, when it has not been drifting during all or part of the day. It is all right for travelling north, but we should be having very uncomfortable marches if we were marching the other way.</p>

				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
					<p><i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">November 20. Early morning.</i> Today we have seemed to be walking in circles through space. Wright, by dint of having a man behind to give him a fixed point to steer upon, has steered us quite straight, and we have picked up every cairn. The pony party camped for lunch by two cairns, but they never knew the two cairns were there until a piece of paper blew away and had to be fetched: and it was caught against one of the cairns. They left a flag there to guide us, and though we saw and brought along the flag, we never saw the cairns. The temperature is −22.5°, and it is now blowing a full blizzard. All this snow has hitherto been lying on the ground and making a very soft surface, for though the wind has always been blowing it has never been very strong. This snow and wind, which have now persisted for nine out of the last ten days, make most dispiriting marches; for there is nothing to see, and finding tracks or steering is a constant strain. We are certainly lucky to have been able to march as we have.</p>

				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
					<p><i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">Note on Mules.</i>⁠—The most ardent admirer of mules could not say that they were a success. The question is whether they might be made so. There was really only one thing against them but that is a very important one⁠—they would not eat on the Barrier. From the time they went away to the day they returned (those that did return, poor things) they starved themselves, and yet they pulled biggish loads for 30 days.</p>
					<p>If they would have eaten they would have been a huge success. They travelled faster than the ponies and, with one exception, kept together better than the ponies. If both were eating their ration it is questionable whether a good mule or a good pony is to be preferred. Our mules were of the best, and they were beautifully trained and equipped by the Indian Government: yet on November 13, a fortnight from the start, Wright records, “mules are a poor substitute for ponies. Not many will see Hut Point again, I think. Doubt if any would have got much farther than this if surfaces had been as bad this year as last.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-292" id="noteref-292" epub:type="noteref">292</a></p>
					<p>Though they would not eat oats, compressed fodder and oil-cake, they were quite willing to eat all kinds of other things. If we could have arrived at the mule equivalent to a vegetarian diet they might have pulled to the Beardmore without stopping. The nearest to this diet at which we could arrive was saennegrass, tea leaves, tobacco ash and rope⁠—all of which were eaten with gusto. But supplies were very limited. They ate dog-biscuit as long as they thought we were not looking⁠—but as soon as they realized they were meant to eat it they went on hunger-strike again. But during halts at cairns Rani and Pyaree would stand solemnly chewing the same piece of rope from different ends. Abdullah always led the line, and followed Wright’s ski tracks faithfully, so that if another man was ahead and Wright turned aside Abdullah always turned too. It was quite a manoeuvre for Wright to read the sledge-meter at the back of the sledge. As for Begum: “Got Begum out of a soft patch by rolling her over.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-293" id="noteref-293" epub:type="noteref">293</a></p>
					<p>On the whole the mules failed to adapt themselves to this life, and as such must at present be considered to be a failure for Antarctic work. Certainly those of our ponies which had the best chance to adapt themselves went farthest, such as Nobby and Jimmy Pigg, both of whom had experience of Barrier sledging before they started on the Polar Journey.</p>

				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
					<p><i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">November 21. Early morning.</i> It has cleared at last, the disturbance rolling away to the east during our first march. The surface was very bad and the mules were not going well. At this time last year many of the ponies were still quite difficult to make stand just before starting. But these mules start off now most dolefully. I am afraid they will not all get back to Hut Point.</p>
					<p>Two and a half miles after lunch, <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> just over forty miles from the depot, we turned out to the eastward and found the gear left by the Second Return Party, when Evans was so ill. The theodolite, which belonged to Evans, is I believe there, but though we dug all round we were unable to find it. The ski were all upright, drifted to within six inches of the shoes. Most of the gear was clothing, which we have left, with the skis, in the tank. We brought on a roll of Birdie’s photographs, taken on the plateau, and three geological specimens: deep-seated rocks I think. This was all of importance that there was there.</p>
					<p>The N Ration, which we have now come to, consists of about 40 <abbr>oz.</abbr> of food. At present, doing the work we are doing, and with these high temperatures, −23° when we started, for instance, and −17° now, the men do not want it. For what it was intended for, hard man-hauling, it would probably be an excellent ration, and very satisfying.</p>

				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
					<p><i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">November 22. Early morning.</i> We could not have had a more perfect night to march. Yesterday at 4 <abbr>p.m.</abbr>, holding the thermometer in the sun, the spirit rose to 30°: it was almost too warm in the tent. The cairns show very plainly⁠—in such weather navigation of this kind would be dead easy. But they are already being eaten away and toppling. The pony walls are drifted level⁠—huge drifts, quite hard, running up to windward and down to lee.</p>
					<p>The dogs are getting more hungry, and want to get at the mules, which makes them go better. They went very well today, but too fast once, for we had a general mixup: Bieliglass under the sledge and the rest all tangled up and ready for a fight at the first chance. How one of the front pair of dogs got under the sledge is a mystery.</p>
					<p>Among the Polar Party’s gear is a letter to the King of Norway. It was left by the Norwegians for Scott to take back. It is wrapped in a piece of thin windcloth with one dark check line in it. Coarser and rougher and, I should say, heavier than our Mandelbergs.</p>

					<p><i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">November 23. Early morning.</i> We were to make Dimitri Depot this morning, but we came on in a fog, and the mule party camped after running down the distance. Wright came back and said, “If we have passed it, it’s over there”⁠—and as he pointed the depot showed⁠—not more than 200 yards away. So that is all right. We, the dog party, go on in advance tomorrow, so that no time may be lost, and if the ice is still good, Atkinson will get over to Cape Evans.</p>

					<p><i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">November 24. Early morning.</i> A glut of foot-walloping in soft snow and breaking crusts. We have done between 17 and 18 miles today. We saw no crevasses, and have marked the course well, building up the cairns and leaving two flags⁠—so the mule party should be all right. The dogs were going well behind the ponies, but directly we went ahead they seemed to lose heart. I think they are tired of the Barrier: a cairn now awakens little interest: they know it is only a mark and it does not mean a camp: they are all well fed, and fairly fat and in good condition. With a large number of dogs I suppose one team can go ahead when it is going well⁠—changing places with another⁠—each keeping the others going. But I do not think that these dogs now will do much more; but they have already done as much as any dogs of which we have any record.</p>
					<p>The land is clearing gradually. I have never seen such contrasts of black rock and white snow, and White Island was capped with great ranges of black cumulus, over which rose the pure white peaks of the Royal Society Range in a blue sky. The Barrier itself was quite a deep grey, making a beautiful picture. And now Observation Hill and Castle Rock are in front. I don’t suppose I shall ever see this view again: but it is associated with many memories of returning to home and plenty after some long and hard journeys: in some ways I feel sorry⁠—but I have seen it often enough.</p>

They arrived here on November 6, starting from Evans Coves on September 30. What a relief it is, and how different things seem now! It is the first real bit of good news since February last⁠—it seems an age. We mean to get over the sea-ice, if possible, as soon as we can, and then we shall hear their story.</p>

					<p><i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">November 26. Early morning.</i> Starting from Hut Point about 6:45 <abbr>p.m.</abbr> last evening, we came through by about 9 <abbr>p.m.</abbr>, and sat up talking and hearing all the splendid news till past 2 <abbr>a.m.</abbr> this morning.</p>
					<p>All the Northern Party look very fat and fit, and they are most cheerful about the time they have had, and make light of all the anxious days they must have spent and their hard times.</p>
					<p>I cannot write all their story. When the ship was battling with the pack to try and get in to them they had open water in Terra Nova Bay to the horizon, as seen from 200 feet high. They prepared for the winter, digging their hut into a big snowdrift a mile from where they were landed. They thought that the ship had been wrecked⁠—or that everyone had been taken off from here, and that then the ship had been blown north by a succession of furious gales which they had and could not get back. They never considered seriously the possibility of sledging down the coast before the winter. They got settled in and were very warm⁠—so warm that in August they did away with one door, of which they had three, of biscuit boxes and sacking.</p>
					<p>Their stove was the bottom of an oil tin, and they cooked by dripping blubber on to seal bones, which became soaked with the blubber, and Campbell tells me they cooked almost as quickly as a primus. Of course they were filthy. Their main difficulty was dysentery and ptomaine poisoning.</p>
					<p>Their stories of the winter are most amusing⁠—of “Placing the Plug, or Sports in the Antarctic”; of lectures; of how dirty they were; of their books, of which they had four, including <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">David Copperfield</i>. They had a spare tent, which was lucky, for the bamboos of one of theirs were blown in during a big wind, and the men inside it crept along the piedmont on hands and knees to the igloo and slept two in a bag. How the seal seemed as if they would give out, and they were on half rations and very hungry: and they were thinking they would have to come down in the winter, when they got two seals: of the fish they got from the stomach of a seal⁠—“the best feed they had”⁠—the blubber they have eaten.</p>
					<p>But they were buried deep in the snow and quite warm. Big winds all the time from the <abbr epub:type="se:compass">W. S. W.</abbr>, cold winds off the plateau⁠—in the igloo they could hear almost nothing outside⁠—how they just had a biscuit a day at times, sugar on Sundays, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr></p>
					<p>And so all is well in this direction, and we have done right in going south, and we have at least succeeded in getting all records. I suppose any news is better than no news.</p>

					<p><i epub:type="se:diary.dateline">Evening.</i> The Pole Party photos of themselves at the Pole and at the Norwegian cairn (a Norwegian tent, post and two flags) are very good indeed⁠—one film is unused, one used on these two subjects: taken with Birdie’s camera. All the party look fit and well, and their clothes are not iced up. It was calm at the time: the surface looks rather soft.</p>
					<p>Atkinson and Campbell have gone to Hut Point with one dog-team, and we are all to forgather here. The ice still seems good from here to Hut Point: all else open water as far as can be seen.</p>
					<p>A steady southerly wind has been blowing here for three days now. The mules should get into Hut Point today.</p>
					<p>It is the happiest day for nearly a year⁠—almost the only happy one.</p>
